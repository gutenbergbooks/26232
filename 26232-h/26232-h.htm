<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>THE MENDED DRUM</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Rub-a-dub, dub! Bang! Rub-a-dub-dub&mdash;Bang!
Bang!&#8221; Sunny Boy thumped his drum vigorously.</p>
<p>Usually when he made such a racket some
one would come out and ask him what in the
world was he making a noise like that for,
but this morning every one seemed to be very
busy. For several minutes now Sunny Boy
had been trying to attract Harriet&#8217;s attention.
She was doing something to the front
door.</p>
<p>&#8220;I spect she needs me,&#8221; said Sunny Boy
to himself.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span></div>
<p>There were any number of interesting
things going on around the front door this
morning, but he was chiefly interested in
Harriet, because as a rule he had to help her
Saturday mornings by going with her to the
grocery store at the corner. He liked to
stand in her clean, comfortable kitchen and
drum for her until she was ready to start.</p>
<p>This particular morning Harriet&#8217;s mind
seemed to be far away from music. She was
rubbing briskly as Sunny Boy watched her,
polishing&mdash;that was it: she was shining the
brass numbers on the door&mdash;266. Sunny
Boy knew them, and how careful Harriet
was to keep them always bright.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just think,&#8221; she would say, as they might
be coming up the steps; &#8220;suppose the postman
had a letter for 266 Glenn Avenue, and
the numbers were so dull and streaked he
couldn&#8217;t read them! Think how we&#8217;d feel
if that should happen to us!&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny Boy was sure such a thing could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
never happen, not with Harriet rubbing
away at the numbers morning after morning.</p>
<p>From his post at the head of the stairs he
could see a man on a step-ladder, working
and whistling. He was hammering in nails
over the door. Dimly Sunny Boy made out
another pair of doors standing in the hall.</p>
<p>&#8220;Goodness, Sunny Boy, I nearly fell over
you!&#8221; Aunt Bessie kissed him on the back
of his neck before he could turn round.
That was a trick Aunt Bessie had, and Sunny
Boy was used to it. &#8220;Are you watching
them put up the screens and awnings?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are they?&#8221; asked Sunny interestedly.
&#8220;Could I hold the awning? Maybe the man
would like my tool-chest&mdash;it&#8217;s all there but
the hammer. I lost that in the park. Can
I help, Auntie?&#8221;</p>
<p>Aunt Bessie was going downtown, and
she was in a hurry. &#8220;If you don&#8217;t get in the
way, I daresay they&#8217;ll be glad to have you,&#8221;
she said kindly, and brushed by him, on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
down the stairs. She stopped to speak to
some one in the parlor, and then Sunny Boy
saw her go out and down the steps.</p>
<p>Sunny Boy sat down on the top stair and
took his drum in his lap. Presently he
would go down and help the awning man,
but it was very pleasant where he was. The
softest little May breeze came wandering
through the open door up to him, and the
canary in the dining room was singing his
cheerful loudest. Sunny Boy leaned his
curly head against the bannister to listen.</p>
<p>His real name, of course, was not Sunny
Boy&mdash;oh, no, he was named for his grandpa,
and when the postman brought him an invitation
to a birthday party you might see it
written out&mdash;Arthur Bradford Horton.</p>
<p>But birthday parties happen only once in
a while, and Daddy and Mother called him
Sunny Boy because he was nearly always
cheerful. As Mother explained, you can&#8217;t
depend on a party happening to cheer you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
up, so to know a little boy who is sure to
smile every day&mdash;well, that is worth while.
And often Sunny forgot that he had any
other name.</p>
<p>Bump&mdash;bang&mdash;bumpty, bang! Down
the stairs suddenly rolled the drum, making
a fearful racket on the steps as it bounded
from side to side. Down the stairs it rolled,
across the narrow strip of hall, past Harriet,
now on her knees scrubbing the green
and white tiles, under the ladder of the
awning man, down the steps, and right out
into the street! After it scrambled Sunny
Boy, as fast as his tan sandals would take
him. He was just in time to see his drum
roll to the middle of the street and stop in
the center of the heavy traffic. A big furniture
van, drawn by three horses, was
headed right for it.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll be smashed! Oh, oh!&#8221; Sunny Boy
wailed, hopping up and down on the curb,
but remembering even in his excitement that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
he had promised not to go off the pavement
when alone. &#8220;They&#8217;ll ride right over my
drum!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess not!&#8221; cried a tall man, and darted
out from behind Sunny. He rushed to
where the drum lay and snatched it up,
almost from under the horses&#8217; feet.</p>
<p>The colored man driving the furniture
van grinned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most busted dat drum for sure!&#8221; he
shouted. &#8220;If this off horse, Billy, ever put
his foot through it, good-by drum!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And there you are!&#8221; The tall man gave
Sunny Boy back his drum with a flourish.
&#8220;Just as good as new, except for a little hole
that I&#8217;m willing to bet a cookie your mother
can mend for you. Isn&#8217;t she waving for you
to come in? I thought so. You run along
now, and see if she doesn&#8217;t mend it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mother was on the front steps watching
for him. Sunny thanked the tall man, who
said that it was nothing, nothing at all: he&#8217;d
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
never rescued a drum before, but he was glad
to have the experience, and that things always
turned out well for small boys who
stayed on the sidewalks and didn&#8217;t dash out
into the streets to get run over. Then
Sunny climbed up the steps and held out his
drum for Mother to see.</p>
<p>&#8220;The man said you could mend it,&#8221; he
said wistfully. &#8220;Can you, Mother?
&#8217;Cause when things break, I miss &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Horton managed to hug her son,
drum and all, though there really wasn&#8217;t
much space where they stood. She was
under the awning man&#8217;s ladder, and he was
shaking and moving the large awning about.
Inside the door stood Harriet and her brush
and bucket.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, &#8217;twas the drum!&#8221; smiled Harriet.
&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t see what it was went rolling by
me like lightning, and Sunny Boy tearing
after it. All I heard was a noise like
thunder.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll go up to my room and mend the
drum,&#8221; declared Mrs. Horton. &#8220;Tell Mr.
Bray I&#8217;ll telephone him about the slip-covers,
please, Harriet. I left him in the
parlor when I ran out to see what was happening
to Sunny Boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What,&#8221; demanded Sunny Boy, carrying
his drum upstairs&mdash;and you may be sure that
he gripped it tightly this time&mdash;&#8220;What are
slip-covers, Mother?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Horton laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, slip-covers are&mdash;&#8221; She thought
a minute. &#8220;They are covers for the chairs
and sofas to wear in summer,&#8221; she explained.
&#8220;Nice, cool, linen covers, you
know, for the furniture, just as you have
summer suits.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny Boy understood. He usually did
when Mother answered his questions. And
he was very sure that she could mend his
drum.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know,&#8221; said Mrs. Horton, when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
she had looked at the hole, &#8220;I think, Sunny
Boy, we can mend this nicely with court-plaster?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Court-plaster?&#8221; echoed Sunny Boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have some in the medicine closet in the
bathroom,&#8221; went on Mrs. Horton, drawing
the edges of the hole together as she talked.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll get it, dear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like mending fingers, isn&#8217;t it,
Mother?&#8221; Sunny Boy was so anxious to
watch how Mother mended the drum that
he nearly put his own pink nose in the hole.
&#8220;When Daddy cut his finger he put court-plaster
on it. He said the skin would grow
together, and it did&mdash;when he took it off,
there wasn&#8217;t any cut there. Just nothing.
Will my drum be like that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, precious,&#8221; answered Mother, snipping
around the edges of the court-plaster
with the fascinating sharp shears Sunny Boy
was forbidden to touch. &#8220;A drum, you
know, isn&#8217;t like a person&#8217;s skin. It can&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
grow. But I think that if you remember to
be careful the drum will last a long time.
There you are. My goodness! it makes as
much noise as ever, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221; and Mrs.
Horton covered her ears and laughed as
Sunny Boy beat merrily on his mended
drum.</p>
<p>&#8220;Letters!&#8221; he cried a minute later as a
shrill whistle sounded. &#8220;I&#8217;ll get &#8217;em for
you, Mother,&#8221; and downstairs again he
tumbled. Only he left the drum safely on
Mother&#8217;s bed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two&mdash;three&mdash;ever so many,&#8221; he announced
proudly when he came back. &#8220;Are
there any for me, Mother?&#8221;</p>
<p>Like some other little folk, Sunny Boy
was always expecting letters, though he
almost never wrote any. But he meant to
write a great many as soon as he learned to
write with ink, and he was even now learning
to print nicely.</p>
<p>&#8220;None for you,&#8221; answered Mrs. Horton,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
glancing at the envelopes. &#8220;However,
here is one with something in it for you, I
suspect. Grandpa Horton has written to
us.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Mother opened this letter, a little note
fell out. That was from Grandpa Horton
to Sunny Boy. He liked to put a little
letter inside his large one, just for his grandson.
Sunny waited quietly while Mother
read her letter. When she had read it
through, she folded it and put it back in the
envelope.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sunny Boy,&#8221; she said, and her voice
made him think of the &#8220;laughing piece&#8221; she
sometimes played for him on the piano. He
looked at her and her eyes were dancing.
&#8220;Sunny Boy,&#8221; she said again, &#8220;what do you
think? We&#8217;re going to visit Grandpa
Horton on his farm&mdash;going to make him a
nice long visit and see the real country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, goody!&#8221; cried Sunny Boy. &#8220;Is
Daddy going?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll come to see us,&#8221; promised Mother.
&#8220;Let me read you what Grandpa has written
you, dear.&#8221;</p>
<p>Grandpa Horton&#8217;s note to Sunny told him
he was depending on him to help him with
the early haying.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t it lucky Harriet rubbed the numbers
on the front door this morning?&#8221;
chuckled Sunny Boy. &#8220;S&#8217;posing we didn&#8217;t
get this letter? Where&#8217;s Brookside,
Mother?&#8221;</p>
<p>Brookside was the name of Grandpa&#8217;s
farm. Mrs. Horton explained that it was
many miles away from the city, and that it
would take them nearly a day on the train to
get there.</p>
<p>&#8220;And if Daddy cannot go with us, you&#8217;ll
have to take care of me,&#8221; she said seriously.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, I will,&#8221; promised Sunny Boy.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll have to go and tell Harriet an&#8217; show her
my letter. I&#8217;ll tell the awning man, too. I
was going to help him, but I don&#8217;t feel helping,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
somehow. I feel wiggled up, you
know, Mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re excited,&#8221; said Mrs. Horton.
&#8220;Well, we don&#8217;t go for two weeks, dear, so
you&#8217;ll have plenty of time to talk about it.
I must write to Grandpa as soon as Daddy
comes home.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dashing out of the room went Sunny Boy,
crying the good news at the top of his lungs&mdash;&#8220;We&#8217;re
going to the country! We&#8217;re going
to my Grandpa&#8217;s farm! Hurrah!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>SPREADING THE NEWS</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;re going off to the country?&#8221;
said Daddy, as he came whistling
down to the dining room, where Mother and
Sunny Boy were waiting for him. &#8220;Well,
I see that I&#8217;ll have to come up and teach you
how to catch a brook trout.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did Mother tell you?&#8221; asked Sunny
Boy, as Daddy swung him into his chair and
Harriet brought in the soup to Mrs. Horton.
&#8220;When did you find out, Daddy? I was
watching for you so&#8217;s I could tell.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t see any little chap in the hall, so
I went right upstairs and found Mother.
She said you were going to Brookside, and
that the awnings were up, and the screens in,
and she hoped to go downtown to-morrow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
and buy your best shoes,&#8221; and Daddy looked
at Mother and laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Daddy is teasing me,&#8221; smiled Mrs.
Horton. &#8220;We have to tell him our news all
in one breath because we see so little of him,
don&#8217;t we, Sunny Boy? I do hope, Harry,
that you&#8217;ll be able to come up this summer
and spend a real vacation at your father&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Horton was making a little well in
the mashed potato on Sunny&#8217;s plate, and
flooding it with the rich brown gravy. That
was the way <i>his</i> father had fixed his mashed
potato for him when he was a little boy, and
Sunny Boy liked his that way, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll come up,&#8221; promised Mr. Horton,
passing the potato to Sunny Boy. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
have to come and show you both where I had
my garden and teach Sunny how to fool the
wise fish.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny Boy put down his fork. He had to
wait a minute because his mouth was full
and Mother had her own opinion of a little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
boy who spoke without chewing his food
properly and swallowing it. Having
swallowed his potato, Sunny Boy was ready
to speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Daddy!&#8221; he began eagerly, &#8220;were
you ever at Brookside? Where was your
garden? Could I drive horses?&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Daddy and Mother said the same
thing together, both at once, just as if they
were thinking the same thing, as they probably
were:</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Sunny Boy!&#8221; said Daddy and
Mother.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t have forgotten,&#8221; urged Mrs.
Horton, then. &#8220;Brookside, you know, dear,
is where Daddy lived when he was a little
boy. When he was just as old as you are
now he used to play there were Indians in
the woods. I&#8217;ve told you ever so many
times, and now you are going to see the place
yourself where Daddy was a little lad like
you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; said Sunny Boy again.</p>
<p>All during the rest of the dinner he was
very busy, thinking. He had forgotten that
Daddy had lived at Brookside, or, to be more
exact, he had not understood that Grandpa&#8217;s
farm was the same farm on which Daddy had
been a little boy. Sunny Boy was only five
years old, and he had already moved three
times. One lived a long time on a farm it
seemed.</p>
<p>Soon after dinner came bed for Sunny
Boy, and he dreamed that he had fallen
head-first into his drum and that it was very
hot and dark inside. He was kicking madly
to get out, when Mother came in and found
him all wrapped up in the bed-clothes with
his head buried in the pillows. When she
drew down the covers he woke up, and after
she had tucked him in smoothly again and
brought him a drink of cool water, he went
to sleep. And the next thing that happened
was the morning.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span></p>
<p>After breakfast, Sunny Boy went out into
the back yard to play. It wasn&#8217;t a very
large back yard, but it was pretty. There
were ferns along one side, and gay spring
flowers on the other. At one end were
Sunny Boy&#8217;s swing and sand-box, and the
center was in thick, green grass. Mondays
the grass belonged to Harriet, who used it
to walk on when she hung out the clean
clothes, but other days Sunny had the whole
yard pretty much to himself.</p>
<p>There was a little gate cut in the fence on
one side of the yard. Daddy Horton had
made the gate for Sunny Boy and Nelson
and Ruth. Nelson and Ruth were a little
boy and girl who lived next door, at least
Ruth was a little girl&mdash;she was only four
years old&mdash;but Nelson was seven and went
to school. Their last name was Baker, and
they and Sunny Boy had very good times
playing together.</p>
<p>As soon as Sunny Boy came out into his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
yard this morning, the little gate opened,
and in came Ruth, dragging Paulina, her
largest doll, by one arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be cross,&#8221; begged Sunny Boy. &#8220;I
want to tell you something.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not cross,&#8221; said Ruth with dignity.
&#8220;What made you think I was going to be?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Cause you&#8217;re dragging Paulina and you
always treat her like that when you&#8217;re cross,&#8221;
answered Sunny more frankly than tactfully.
&#8220;Listen, Ruth&mdash;we&#8217;re going to the
country to see Grandpa Horton, and I&#8217;m going
to drive horses and go fishing, an&#8217; help
hay, and oh, everything!&#8221;</p>
<p>Ruth was interested.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I go fishing?&#8221; she wanted to know.</p>
<p>Sunny Boy was troubled. Evidently
Ruth thought she was going to the country,
too, and it surely wouldn&#8217;t be very kind to
tell her plainly that Grandpa Horton hadn&#8217;t
invited her. To his relief Mrs. Baker called
Ruth just then and she went into her own
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
yard, still dragging the unfortunate Paulina
by one arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sunny Boy,&#8221; called his own mother from
an upstairs window, &#8220;Harriet is going to the
store for me&mdash;wouldn&#8217;t you like to go with
her?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny Boy liked to go with Harriet, and
he hurried indoors to get his hat and roller
skates. Now Sunny Boy was just learning
to skate, and if he didn&#8217;t have Harriet to
hold on to he never could be quite sure what
was going to happen to him. He could go
much faster on his own two feet, but, as he
explained to Harriet, it was most important
that he should learn how to skate because
when he could skate well he would be able
to go to the store much more quickly than he
could walk. And Harriet said yes, she
understood, and that everybody had to learn
how to skate before they could become really
expert.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you ever live on a farm, Harriet?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
asked Sunny Boy, as they started for the
store. His mind was full of the coming
visit.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; admitted Harriet. &#8220;I never lived
on a farm. But I&#8217;ve often visited people
who did. You&#8217;ll like it. There&#8217;ll be
brooks to wade in, and little calves and
lambs to play with, and chickens and ducks.
And you can play outdoors all day long.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When it rains?&#8221; asked Sunny Boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;When it rains there&#8217;ll be the barn and
the haymow,&#8221; answered Harriet. &#8220;And
now here&#8217;s Mr. Gray&#8217;s. You&#8217;d better wait
out here for me and not try to clatter in with
those skates.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny Boy saw a basket of apples in the
window.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you bring me an apple, Harriet?&#8221;
he teased. &#8220;Mother won&#8217;t mind. Apples
don&#8217;t hurt you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harriet was half way through the door,
but she turned.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too early for good apples yet,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;You wait till you get to Brookside,
Sunny. You&#8217;ll have more apples then than
you can possibly eat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Millions and dozens?&#8221; called Sunny
Boy after Harriet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, &#8216;millions and dozens,&#8217;&#8221; she echoed,
laughing, and closed the grocery store door.</p>
<p>The grocer&#8217;s boy was coming down the
steps, and he laughed, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;Millions and dozens of what?&#8221; he demanded,
stopping before Sunny Boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Apples, at my grandpa&#8217;s farm.&#8221;</p>
<p>The grocer boy had a basket on his arm
and he wore a white coat. He looked very
clean and cheerful. Sunny Boy had a sudden
idea.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re going up to our house, could I
hang on back of your wheel?&#8221; he said. &#8220;I
can skate pretty well if I have some one to
steer with.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think Harriet would like it,&#8221; was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
the grocer boy&#8217;s reply. He knew Sunny
Boy and Harriet because he often came to
their house to bring good things to eat.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you, Sunny Boy&mdash;you wait till you
come back from this visit, and then I&#8217;ll take
you. Or perhaps after you&#8217;ve eaten the
millions and dozens of apples you won&#8217;t
have to hang on to any one&mdash;you&#8217;ll be big
and strong and able to skate by yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny Boy watched him ride merrily off
on his bicycle. Still Harriet didn&#8217;t come.
Sunny suspected there must be a good many
people waiting in the store. He might
skate down to the corner and back before she
had bought all the things on Mother&#8217;s list.</p>
<p>It was all very well for the first few yards,
because there was a convenient iron railing
to cling to, and Sunny Boy found himself
skating very easily. But the iron railing
ended in a stone stoop, and after that there
seemed to be nothing but miles and miles
of pavement without even a friendly tree to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
cling to. Sunny Boy&#8217;s feet began to behave
queerly. One went much faster than the
other and in an entirely different direction,
and he had an idea he&#8217;d have to wear those
skates the rest of his life because he didn&#8217;t
see how he was ever going to stop to take
them off.</p>
<p>Suddenly he found himself headed for an
area-way and a flight of stone steps. He
clutched desperately at the cellar window,
shot past, and down the steps&mdash;bing! into a
huge basket of clothes a fat colored woman
was bringing up. She was as wide as the
basket and the basket took up about all the
area-way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Land sakes, chile!&#8221; she said, as Sunny
Boy landed on top of her basket. &#8220;Where
you goin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Skating,&#8221; said Sunny Boy concisely, glad
to find that he wasn&#8217;t hurt.</p>
<p>The colored woman laughed, a deep, rich,
happy laugh.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You doan seem to be jest sure,&#8221; she told
him. &#8220;Stay where you is an&#8217; I&#8217;ll carry you
on up.&#8221;</p>
<p>She did, too, and started him on his uncertain
way down the street. In a few
minutes his feet began to act strangely again,
this time sending him in the general direction
of the gutter.</p>
<p>&#8220;I spect I&#8217;d better go back,&#8221; said Sunny
Boy to himself. But he couldn&#8217;t turn
around.</p>
<p>Then up the street came a familiar gray-uniformed
figure. It was the postman, the
same merry, kind postman who brought
letters to Sunny Boy&#8217;s house and for whom
Harriet was careful to have the number on
the front door bright and shining.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop me!&#8221; cried Sunny Boy, wobbling
more wildly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right&mdash;O!&#8221; agreed the postman, and
proceeded to stop him by letting Sunny Boy
skate right into him and his mail bag.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And that&#8217;s all right,&#8221; said the cheerful
postman, blowing his whistle and slipping
some letters into a mail-box in a doorway as
if nothing had happened. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you want
to skate back with me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny Boy, seated on a handy doorstep,
was unbuckling the skate straps. He
looked up and smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you very much, but Harriet&#8217;s
waiting for me,&#8221; he answered politely.
&#8220;An&#8217; I have to carry my skates, &#8217;cause she
won&#8217;t let me hold the eggs &#8217;less I walk.&#8221;</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>PACKING THE TRUNK</h3>
</div>

<p>Aunt Bessie sat on the floor of
Mother&#8217;s room, with pencil and paper
in her lap. She was Mrs. Horton&#8217;s sister,
and though she did not live with them,
Sunny Boy and Mother saw her nearly every
day.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if you will need that extra
coat?&#8221; Aunt Bessie was saying, as Sunny
Boy came into the room.</p>
<p>For the two weeks were nearly gone and it
was time to get ready to go to see Grandpa
Horton. Early that morning Daddy had
brought down the big trunk from the storeroom,
and ever since breakfast Mother and
Aunt Bessie had been busy packing clothes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
into it. Aunt Bessie kept a list of the things
they put in so that Mother would be able to
tell when the trunk was full whether she had
left out anything she needed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go and get my things,&#8221; announced
Sunny Boy, and Aunt Bessie blew him a kiss
and went on with her work.</p>
<p>Upstairs Sunny Boy looked a long time
at his toys before he could decide what to
do about them. He couldn&#8217;t leave his
kiddie-car, that was certain. And there was
the woolly black dog he took to bed with him
at night, and a Teddy Bear that he was
almost too old to play with, but not quite,
and the wooden blocks. Then he would be
sure to need his fire-engine and the roller
skates. He must take all those with him.
He made three trips down to Mother&#8217;s door
with the toys, and then, going down for the
third time, he remembered the wind-mill out
in the sand-box and ran out after that and
brought it in.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Bless the child, what is all this?&#8221; cried
Aunt Bessie, as he came into Mother&#8217;s room,
bringing as many of the treasures as he
could carry at one time.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m helping,&#8221; explained Sunny Boy.
&#8220;There&#8217;s more out in the hall.&#8221;</p>
<p>He put down his load and ran out to bring
in the rest.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, precious,&#8221; said Mrs. Horton, looking
from the kiddie-car to her little son,
&#8220;we can&#8217;t take all these things with us.
Why, Mother wouldn&#8217;t have a place to put
your socks and blouses, to say nothing of the
cunning bathing-suit we bought yesterday.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t need them, you know,&#8221; urged
Aunt Bessie. &#8220;You&#8217;ll be so busy playing
with the new things you&#8217;ll find up at Grandpa
Horton&#8217;s that you&#8217;ll probably never remember
the toys at home. Then when you
come back they will seem like new ones.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny Boy was disappointed. His kiddie-car
was the hardest to give up. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
woolly dog, too, was very dear to him. Mrs.
Horton understood, and she sat down in her
low rocking chair and took her little boy on
her lap.</p>
<p>&#8220;The kiddie-car wouldn&#8217;t be any fun in
the country,&#8221; she said. &#8220;There are no stone
pavements, you see, dear, and it wouldn&#8217;t
run on the grass. As for the woolly dog,
why you will have a real dog to play with&mdash;a
collie dog that will run after sticks and
bring them to you and take walks with you.
That will be fun, won&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny Boy slid to the floor and stood up.
He was excited.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am simply crazy to have a real dog,&#8221; he
declared.</p>
<p>Mrs. Horton stared at him, but Aunt
Bessie, bending over the trunk, sat down on
the edge and laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where in the world did you hear that,
Sunny Boy?&#8221; asked Mother. &#8220;Who talks
like that?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span></p>
<p>Aunt Bessie swooped down upon her
nephew.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; she told her sister. &#8220;But I&#8217;ll have
to be more careful when little pitchers with
big ears are about. Why don&#8217;t you copy the
nice things I say, Sunny?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that nice?&#8221; puzzled Sunny.
&#8220;Shouldn&#8217;t I say it? Why not, Mother?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t wrong, dear,&#8221; Mrs. Horton
assured him. &#8220;Aunt Bessie only means
that speaking that way is rather a bad habit
to get into. We call it exaggeration. Let
me see, how shall I make you understand?
Well, if I say &#8216;I&#8217;m starving to death,&#8217; when
I mean that I am hungrier than usual for
dinner, that&#8217;s exaggeration. I couldn&#8217;t be
starving, unless I had had nothing to eat for
several days.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And though some people think I&#8217;m crazy,
I&#8217;m really not,&#8221; concluded Aunt Bessie
gayly. &#8220;You think I&#8217;m rather nice, don&#8217;t
you, Sunny? And now I wonder if there&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
a young man about who would be kind
enough to take this skirt down to Harriet
and ask her to please press the hem?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; offered Sunny Boy. &#8220;And then
I&#8217;ll come back and put my things away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;While you are down in the kitchen, I
wish you&#8217;d ask Harriet if the oven is ready
for me to make some biscuits for lunch,&#8221; said
Mrs. Horton. &#8220;And tell her I said you
might have a glass of milk and one of the
sponge cakes without any pink icing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harriet pressed the skirt while Sunny Boy
sat at one end of the ironing board and
watched her and ate his sponge cake&mdash;which
was almost as good as the kind with pink
icing which were only for dessert&mdash;and
drank his milk. Then Harriet gave him the
skirt to carry back to Aunt Bessie and he
remembered to ask about the oven. Harriet
said to tell Mother that it was just right for
baking biscuits.</p>
<p>&#8220;That means I must go down right away,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
said Mrs. Horton, when Sunny Boy told her.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve about finished anyway, haven&#8217;t we,
Bessie? The man is to come at three this
afternoon for the trunk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve left a few chinks and corners, in case
you want to tuck in some little trifles at the
last minute,&#8221; replied Aunt Bessie, &#8220;but
otherwise it&#8217;s ready to be strapped and
locked.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me lock it,&#8221; said Sunny Boy eagerly.
&#8220;I can stand on the top, too. I did for
Cousin Lola when hers wouldn&#8217;t shut.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Horton was tying on a nice clean
white apron.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, dearest,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Mother
isn&#8217;t quite ready to have the trunk locked.
If we&#8217;ve packed it so full it won&#8217;t close, why
of course I&#8217;ll call on you to stand on the top
and make it shut.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny Boy hoped the trunk wouldn&#8217;t
close, for he wanted to dance on the top.
Then Mrs. Horton went down to Harriet&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
kitchen to make puffy white biscuits for lunch
and Aunt Bessie went off to give a music
lesson.</p>
<p>Sunny Boy, left to put away his toys, explained
matters to the woolly dog as he
carried him upstairs.</p>
<p>&#8220;There will be a real dog for me to play
with at Grandpa&#8217;s,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And little
calves and lambs&mdash;Harriet said so. Maybe
you might get broken in the trunk, anyway.
But I won&#8217;t like the real dog one bit more
than I do you, and when we come back you
can sleep with me every single night.&#8221;</p>
<p>The woolly dog seemed to think this was
all right, and he took it so cheerfully that
Sunny Boy felt better immediately.</p>
<p>Mr. Horton came home to lunch, which
was unusual, and after lunch he and Mrs.
Horton had to go downtown to see about the
tickets and the parlor car seats for the trip
the next day. Sunny Boy was to take his
nap and be wide awake again by three
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
o&#8217;clock, when the man was coming to take
their trunk to the station.</p>
<p>Sunny Boy did not see how they were to
find the trunk again if they once let it go,
for surely no trunk could go all alone to
Brookside. He resolved to ask Daddy.
While he was wondering if there would be
a piano in the parlor car&mdash;and he rather
hoped there would and that he might be allowed
to play on it&mdash;Sunny Boy fell asleep.
Harriet, coming upstairs with a pile of clean
clothes, woke him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it three o&#8217;clock?&#8221; he asked, afraid that
he had missed the trunk man.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only half-past two,&#8221; answered Harriet.
&#8220;Your mother will be back any minute now
to lock the trunk. You can dress yourself,
can&#8217;t you? I&#8217;ve another tablecloth to iron
yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny Boy could dress himself, of course.
Wandering into Mother&#8217;s room to borrow
her hairbrush, he saw the little nickel alarm
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
clock on the table. Mother must have
meant to pack that, and in her hurry had forgotten.
Sunny Boy remembered that
Daddy had told him all country folk &#8220;rose
with the chickens,&#8221; and upon inquiry he had
learned that the chickens rose very early
indeed&mdash;almost as soon as the sun. Sunny
Boy thought it would be dreadful if he and
Mother should oversleep their first morning
at the farm and come downstairs to find the
chickens up and the farmer people laughing
at them. Yes, the alarm clock certainly
must go.</p>
<p>He had not a very clear idea of how one
went about it to set an alarm clock, but
Daddy, he remembered, always wound the
little pegs in the back. So Sunny Boy
trustingly wound all the pegs he saw, as
tight as they would turn, and tucked the
clock away down deep in one of the corner
holes Aunt Bessie had left in the trunk.</p>

And tucked the clock away down deep in one of the corner holes Aunt Bessie had left in the trunk.<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span></div>
<p>He had hardly packed it in when Mother
came running breathlessly up the stairs crying
that the express wagon was at the door.
Hurriedly she put down the trunk lid,
locked it, and tied on the tag that Daddy had
written for her.</p>
<p>&#8220;That tells the train folks what to do with
it,&#8221; explained the trunk man to Sunny,
swinging the heavy trunk to his shoulder as
though it weighed no more than the kiddie-car
and trotting downstairs with it.</p>
<p>Sunny Boy watched him put it in the
wagon and drive away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now we&#8217;re almost ready,&#8221; said Mrs.
Horton smilingly. &#8220;We have to pack our
bag and go to bed early, and then, in the
morning, we really will be on our way to
Grandpa Horton&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But there&#8217;s the canary,&#8221; Sunny Boy reminded
her hesitatingly. &#8220;Can I carry
him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The train would frighten him so he
might never sing any more,&#8221; said Mrs.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
Horton. &#8220;No, Aunt Bessie is going to keep
him for us till we come back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, let&#8217;s go now,&#8221; urged Sunny.
&#8220;Why can&#8217;t we go this minute? Let&#8217;s,
Mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And have Daddy come home to dinner
to-night and find us gone?&#8221; said Mother reproachfully.
&#8220;Why, Sunny!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;then perhaps we&#8217;d better wait,&#8221;
admitted Sunny Boy. &#8220;But one whole
night&#8217;s an awful long time, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>OFF FOR BROOKSIDE</h3>
</div>

<p>Perhaps the most fun of going on a
journey is the fun of starting.</p>
<p>Sunny Boy began to get excited the
moment he opened his eyes the next morning,
and if he had had his way, they wouldn&#8217;t
have bothered with such an every-day affair
as breakfast. One could eat breakfast any
morning, but a trip on the train to one&#8217;s
grandfather&#8217;s farm was much more important.</p>
<p>However, Daddy explained that all experienced
travelers ate a good breakfast before
they set out, and as Sunny Boy wanted
above all things to do as real travelers did,
he consented to sit down and be interested
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
for a few moments in his blue oatmeal bowl
and its contents.</p>
<p>&#8220;You look so nice, Mother,&#8221; he told Mrs.
Horton suddenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;So do you,&#8221; she assured him, smiling.
&#8220;I think it must be because we are both wearing
our new blue serge suits.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Remember, you&#8217;re going to take care of
my girl,&#8221; warned Daddy. &#8220;Don&#8217;t let her
get too tired, and try to make her comfortable,
and don&#8217;t let any one or anything
bother her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny Boy gravely promised to look after
Mother. He felt very proud that Daddy
trusted him to take care of her on their first
long journey together, and he resolved to
wait on her all he could and to save her every
possible step.</p>
<p>Harriet, who was not going with them,
but who was going to help Aunt Bessie keep
house until they came back, was bustling
about, pulling down shades and closing and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
locking doors. The canary had gone, and
Sunny Boy had a funny feeling that their
house was going on a journey, too. In his
trotting around after Harriet, while Mother
was telephoning a last good-by to some
friend, he found a square white box on the
parlor table, neatly tied with red string&mdash;one
of that mysterious kind that makes your
fingers fairly itch to untie the string and
look inside. Sunny Boy went in search of
Mother.</p>
<p>&#8220;Could I open it?&#8221; he asked coaxingly.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll tie it right up again, Mother. Maybe
you have forgotten what is in it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Deed I haven&#8217;t!&#8221; laughed Mrs. Horton.
&#8220;Give it to me, dear. It&#8217;s a surprise for you&mdash;we&#8217;ll
open it on the train.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny Boy obediently handed her the
package, and in a few minutes he had forgotten
all about it.</p>
<p>At last the house was ready to leave, and
Harriet kissed him and said good-by.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
Sunny Boy watched her down the street until
she turned the corner. He had a little ache
in his throat, but he was too big a boy to cry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Precious,&#8221; said Mother who knew perhaps
how he was feeling, &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;ve
left my little coin purse on my bureau.
Would you mind going up and getting it
for me?&#8221;</p>
<p>The house upstairs was very still and hot.
Sunny Boy tiptoed softly as he hurried into
Mother&#8217;s room. There on the bureau lay
the little silver purse and a clean handkerchief
that smelled like a bunch of violets.</p>
<p>&#8220;You left your hanky, Mother,&#8221; he cried,
running downstairs. &#8220;And you said folks
should never, never, begin to go anywhere
without a clean hanky, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Horton, standing on the front step,
opened the screen door and put in his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Taxi&#8217;s coming!&#8221; he announced.
&#8220;Ready, Olive? I have the bag right here.
Come, son.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span></p>
<p>Sunny Boy was thrilled at the thought of
riding in that orange dragon of an automobile.
Mother and Daddy had friends
who often took them motoring pleasant
afternoons, and sometimes Sunny Boy went
with them. But every one knows that is
different from having a gay colored car roll
up to your front door and wait especially for
you.</p>
<p>The young man who drove the car opened
the door with a flourish and helped Mrs.
Horton in. Then he turned to lift Sunny
Boy, but that young person hung back.</p>
<p>&#8220;I could ride with you&mdash;up front,&#8221; he
suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you might tumble out, going around
the corner,&#8221; cried Mrs. Horton.</p>
<p>Daddy, who had been locking the front
door, came down to them, carrying the black
leather bag that was to go with Sunny Boy
and Mother.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know,&#8221; said Daddy slowly, &#8220;I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
think the bag will have to go in the front
seat, Sunny? I wouldn&#8217;t like to put it
down on Mother&#8217;s pretty new patent leather
pumps. Sometime when we have no baggage
you shall ride with the chauffeur.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Sunny Boy climbed in and sat between
Mother and Daddy, and the chauffeur just
touched his wheel and they shot off up the
street. Indeed they started so suddenly
that Sunny Boy went over backward and
laughed so hard that he quite forgot to be
disappointed because he could not sit on the
front seat.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s in the bag, Mother?&#8221; he asked,
as they rolled along through the streets.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hair-brushes and combs and towels and
soap, and your tooth-brush and mine, and
the tooth-paste,&#8221; answered Mrs. Horton.
&#8220;And pajamas for you and a nightie for me,
in case we can&#8217;t get the trunk to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it is going on the train just like us,&#8221;
urged Sunny Boy. &#8220;Daddy said so.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But it will be nearly night before we
reach Brookside,&#8221; explained Mrs. Horton,
&#8220;and Grandpa will meet us with a horse and
surrey most likely. We will have to leave
the trunk at the station till some one can go
and get it for us in the morning. I have a
play suit in the bag for you, though, so trunk
or no trunk, you can be real country boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Presently the taxi rolled up under a stone
arch, and Mr. Horton said they were at the
station. They all got out and went into
a great space filled with people. Porters
were rushing about with suitcases and bags,
crowds of men and women were going in
several directions at once, and a man running
for his train nearly ran right over
Sunny Boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get the trunk checked and then give
you the tickets,&#8221; Mr. Horton said to his wife.
&#8220;You sit down over there by the door where
I can find you, and I&#8217;ll be back in five
minutes. We have plenty of time.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span></p>
<p>Sunny Boy and Mother sat down by the
door and watched the people. Opposite
them sat a short, fat woman with a baby in
her arms and five little children, two girls
and three boys, in the seats nearest her.
They were each sucking a lolly-pop and took
turns giving the baby a taste. Although
they were very sticky and not exactly tidy,
they seemed to love one another very much
and to be having a very good time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where do you suppose they&#8217;re going?&#8221;
Sunny Boy asked.</p>
<p>Mrs. Horton did not know. Perhaps, if
they watched them, they might see them take
the train.</p>
<p>Then Sunny Boy wanted to know where
they kept the trains. He could hear them,
and nearly every minute a man with a big
trumpet&mdash;which Mother said was a megaphone&mdash;would
call out something, and
from all over the station people would come
rushing to get on the train. But though
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
Sunny Boy watched carefully, he could not
see a single smokestack.</p>
<p>&#8220;The trains are downstairs&mdash;you&#8217;ll see
when we go out,&#8221; said Mrs. Horton. &#8220;I
wonder what can be keeping your father?
He has been gone almost fifteen minutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will there be a piano in the parlor
car?&#8221; Sunny Boy wanted to know next.</p>
<p>Mrs. Horton laughed merrily.</p>
<p>&#8220;A parlor car is like the rest of the cars in
a train, except that the seats are more comfortable,&#8221;
she explained. &#8220;Anyway, we
have to go in an ordinary coach, because
Daddy and I couldn&#8217;t get a single parlor car
seat yesterday. They had all been taken.
I don&#8217;t see what can have happened to
Daddy!&#8221;</p>
<p>Just then Mr. Horton came up to them.
There was a baggage man with him and they
both looked rather excited.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you&#8217;ll have to come over to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
baggage room, Olive,&#8221; said Mr. Horton in
a low voice, &#8220;and see what you can do about
straightening out this mess. They want to
know what you&#8217;ve packed in the trunk.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny Boy clung tightly to Mother&#8217;s hand
while they walked over to a low, broad window
on one side of the station wall. This
opened into the baggage room, and a perfect
ocean of trunks was being tossed about in
there. The pink came into Mother&#8217;s cheeks
as she saw the crowd gathered about the
window.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, Ma&#8217;am,&#8221; said the big, tall man
at the window in a gruff voice that was somehow
kind and friendly, too, &#8220;it&#8217;s like this&mdash;we
figure out something blew up in that
trunk of yours about ten o&#8217;clock last night,
and naturally we want to know something
about it. In fact, we can&#8217;t check the trunk
for you until we do. A dozen men heard
it, and&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t understand,&#8221; protested Mrs.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
Horton. &#8220;I packed nothing that could possibly
blow up, as you say. My sister and I
put everything in with our own hands. I
even have a list. I can show you that&mdash;&#8221;
she fumbled in her velvet handbag with
fingers that trembled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Probably an infernal machine,&#8221; declared
a shrill voice in the crowd that was now
growing too large for comfort. &#8220;With the
country in the unsettled state it is now, you
can look for anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s a &#8217;fernal &#8217;chine?&#8221; asked Sunny
Boy boldly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Like a bomb&mdash;it goes off with a whang,&#8221;
answered a freckle-faced boy standing near.
He reminded Sunny of his friend, the
grocery boy.</p>
<p>The words, &#8220;Goes off with a whang,&#8221; reminded
Sunny Boy of something, though.
He looked up into the friendly blue eyes of
the baggage-window man.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe&mdash;&#8221; began Sunny Boy, &#8220;Maybe,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
I guess it was the alarm clock I packed!&#8221; he
finished bravely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll be hanged!&#8221; said the baggage-window
man. His blue eyes crinkled.</p>
<p>The crowd had heard, and a ripple of
laughter ran through them. As suddenly as
they had gathered, they melted away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me have your tickets,&#8221; said the baggage-window
man. &#8220;I guess you can still
make the ten-forty-five.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>ON THE TRAIN</h3>
</div>

<p>Well, though, as Mr. Horton expressed
it, they &#8220;had to hustle,&#8221;
they did make the ten-forty-five. They
went down in an elevator to board the train
and the ticket man at the gate would not let
Mr. Horton through.</p>
<p>Daddy hugged his little boy tight before
he let him go, and Mother had diamonds in
her pretty brown eyes as she turned from
saying good-by to him. But when they
looked back to wave to him, there was Daddy
smiling gayly at them and waving his hat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have a fine time,&#8221; he called. &#8220;Take
care of Mother, Sunny Boy. And look for
me exactly three weeks from to-day.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span></p>
<p>Sunny Boy and Mother found a seat after
they had walked through a number of cars
that were filled, and, though it was rather
dark, Sunny Boy could make out the people
near them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look, Mother,&#8221; he whispered, &#8220;there&#8217;s
the woman with the baby and the other
children we saw in the station. Isn&#8217;t it
funny they took our train?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sure enough, there they were, a little
further down the aisle on the other side of
the car, lolly-pops and all.</p>
<p>Mrs. Horton took off her hat and Sunny
Boy&#8217;s and put them in a large paper bag she
took from her bag.</p>
<p>&#8220;That will keep them clean,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;and we shall be cooler and more comfortable
without them. We may have to shut
the window when we get out of the tunnel,
but we need the air now. Now we&#8217;re off!
Hear the conductor calling?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All a-bo-ard,&#8221; Sunny Boy heard some one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
crying. &#8220;All a-bo-ard!&#8221; and soon the train
began to move.</p>
<p>Slowly they rumbled out of the dark gray
of the train shed, past so many snorting,
sniffing black iron engines that Sunny Boy
did not see why they did not run into each
other, past a crew of men working on the
railroad tracks, past red and green lights,
into a tunnel without a roof, but walled high
on either side with smooth concrete walls.
Just as Sunny Boy grew tired of looking at
this wall, it stopped, and the train was
merrily rushing along through open streets.
Sunny Boy looked at Mother and smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it fun?&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>For a long time Sunny Boy amused himself
by watching the country through which
they were riding. They passed one or two
little stations without stopping, and at the
crossings Sunny Boy saw children waving to
the train. He waved to them and hoped
that they saw him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Tickets!&#8221; The conductor had reached
their car.</p>
<p>Mrs. Horton took a ticket from her bag
and gave it to her son. He held it out and
the conductor punched it and passed on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you want me to keep it?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll put it in my purse so it can&#8217;t be lost,&#8221;
Mother answered. &#8220;But when the conductor
asks for it again you may give it to
him. He won&#8217;t come again for ever so
long.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Sunny Boy was watching an automobile
racing with the train on a road that
ran alongside the tracks, a white-aproned
colored man came into their car.</p>
<p>&#8220;First call for lunch!&#8221; he shouted.
&#8220;First call for lunch!&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny Boy felt suddenly hungry. Down
the aisle the woman with all the children had
opened a pasteboard box and they were having
a picnic right there. Other people were
eating sandwiches.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll go and get our lunch,&#8221; decided
Mrs. Horton. &#8220;Be careful going down the
aisle, dear, and don&#8217;t bump into people any
more than you can help.&#8221;</p>
<p>They had to go through a parlor car to
reach the dining car, and Sunny Boy saw for
himself that there was no piano, nothing but
chairs on either side of the aisle. A colored
waiter helped him into his seat at a little
table in the dining car, and he thought it
great fun to eat chicken broth while looking
out of the window at the telegraph poles galloping
by. The poles seemed to be moving
instead of the train, but Sunny Boy knew
the train really moved.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will there be another call for lunch?&#8221; he
asked, remembering what the man had
shouted, as he ate his mashed potato and
peas.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh yes, but we won&#8217;t come,&#8221; said Mrs.
Horton. &#8220;That will be for the people who
weren&#8217;t hungry when we were.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span></p>
<p>A man at the table across from theirs
picked up the menu card.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now what on earth shall I order for
dessert?&#8221; he frowned. &#8220;If the doctor won&#8217;t
let me have meat, I suppose I have to eat
something.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Chocolate ice-cream,&#8221; suggested Sunny
Boy helpfully, feeling sorry for any one who
did not know that it was the finest dessert in
the world.</p>
<p>The frown slid away from the man&#8217;s face
and he grinned cheerfully at the small
boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that what you are going to have?&#8221; he
demanded. &#8220;All right then, I will, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>And when it came, a neat little mountain
of it, he and Sunny smiled again at each
other before they buried their silver spoons
in the beautiful dark iciness of it.</p>
<p>Back in their seat in their car, Sunny was
restless. To Mother&#8217;s suggestion that he
take a nap, he said that he didn&#8217;t feel sleepy.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
He wished he had something to do&mdash;he was
tired of looking at trees and things.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hoped you would take a little nap, but
I suppose there is too much excitement,&#8221;
said Mrs. Horton. &#8220;Well, then, how would
you like to see the surprise now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The surprise?&#8221; repeated Sunny Boy.
&#8220;Oh, Mother&mdash;is that the box?&#8221;</p>
<p>For answer Mrs. Horton opened the
leather bag and took out the box neatly
wrapped in white paper that Sunny Boy had
seen on the parlor table at home. She put
it in his lap and then took up the magazine
she was reading.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh my!&#8221; said Sunny Boy, when he had
pulled off string and paper and lifted the lid.</p>
<p>Inside the box were six little packages,
each wrapped in white paper and tied with
pink string. It was like Christmas. Sunny
Boy unwrapped them all, one after another,
and underneath he found two long thin
boxes, also wrapped and tied.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span></p>
<p>In the first package he found a box of
colored crayons; in another, a little pad of
drawing paper; another held an envelope
stamped and addressed and a sheet of writing
paper. In another was a lead pencil;
the fifth was a cake of sweet chocolate, and
the sixth package was a little lump of modeling
wax. The two long thin packages
proved to be boxes of animal crackers.</p>
<p>Sunny Boy was chiefly interested in the
envelope, because he could not read the writing
on it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s it to, Mother?&#8221; he urged.
&#8220;Your writing runs into letters so I can&#8217;t
read it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Horton explained that the envelope
was addressed to Daddy, and that she
thought she and Sunny Boy might write a
little note to him and that he would have
it in the morning.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there a mail-box on the train?&#8221; asked
Sunny, in surprise.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, dear. But we will give it to the
conductor and he will see that it is mailed at
the next station where we stop. You print
on one side of the sheet, and I will write a
little message on the other.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, taking great pains and holding the
pencil very tightly because the motion of the
train made it wobble in his fingers, Sunny
Boy printed this:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>DEER DADDY: I LOV YOU.</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>WE ARE HAVING A NICE TIME</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>ON THE TRANE. I AM TAKING</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>CARE OF MOTHER. YOUR</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>LOVING SUN, SUNNY BOY.</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Then Mother wrote her note, and they
folded it up and sealed the letter and Sunny
gave it to the conductor when he next came
through.</p>
<p>After that he drew pictures and colored
them with the crayons and nibbled at his
chocolate and modeled dogs and cats and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
horses with the wax. He opened the cracker
boxes, too, and played Noah&#8217;s ark with them.
The children down the aisle watched him
and nudged each other. Their mother
would not let them out into the aisle, or very
likely they would have come closer to see
what that boy was doing with so many nice
things.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like, Mother,&#8221; announced Sunny Boy
suddenly, &#8220;to pass my crackers to the little
boy with the green tie&mdash;he looks like Nelson
Baker. Would that be all right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, of course,&#8221; agreed Mrs. Horton.
&#8220;Ask their mother if she is willing for them
to have some, and give some to each child,
dear. And don&#8217;t stay too long, because I
shall miss you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny Boy went down the aisle to the
seats where the children were. The lolly-pops
had disappeared long ago, and so had
the picnic sandwiches. They were all
stickier than ever, were those children. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
heavy baby was asleep in his mother&#8217;s lap,
and she smiled when Sunny asked her if she
were willing he should pass his crackers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, they&#8217;d like &#8217;em first-rate,&#8221;
she said, speaking low so as not to wake the
baby. &#8220;Mamie, Ellen, Jamie, Fred, George&mdash;say
thank you, and don&#8217;t grab.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny Boy stayed a little while, talking
to them all, and they told him they were going
to another state far away. They would
be all night on the train. Sunny Boy was a
bit disappointed that he must get off at
Cloverways, the nearest station to Grandpa&#8217;s
farm, for he had never stayed all night
on a train in his life. He hurried back to
Mother to tell her of the fortunate family
who were to spend the night on the train.</p>
<p>&#8220;That poor woman!&#8221; Mother, to his
astonishment, exclaimed. &#8220;She&#8217;ll be worn
out before she gets all those children safely
somewhere. Think of sitting up all night
with that fretful baby! I&#8217;ll tell you, Sunny
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
Boy&mdash;we get off in about half an hour now;
wouldn&#8217;t you like to leave your surprise
package to amuse those children who are going
farther than we are? I&#8217;ll help you tie
them up again, and I have two more cakes
of chocolate in the bag. You are so careful
with your things they are not hurt at all, and
it will keep them busy for an hour or two,
playing with them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny Boy thought this a fine plan, and
he hardly had all the packages tied up and in
the box again when Mrs. Horton pinned on
her hat and gave him his, saying that the
next station was theirs. She went down the
aisle with him and they gave the surprise box
to the five youngsters who were delighted to
have something new to look at. And then
the train stopped, and the brakeman lifted
Sunny Boy down, and he found an old
gentleman was kissing Mother.</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>BROOKSIDE</h3>
</div>

<p>Sunny Boy found himself looking
into two dark eyes so much like
Daddy&#8217;s that he almost jumped. But the
rest of the old gentleman was not like
Daddy&mdash;no indeed. He was short and
round instead of tall, and he had the curliest
white hair and beard Sunny Boy had ever
seen. Sunny Boy knew this must be
Grandpa Horton, and when he was lifted up
in a pair of strong arms and given a tremendous
hug before being gently set down,
he decided that he loved him very much.</p>
<p>&#8220;Grandma couldn&#8217;t come,&#8221; explained
Grandpa, leading the way to an old-fashioned
carriage and pair of horses drawn
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
up at the other end of the station. &#8220;There&#8217;s
only Araminta to help her with the supper,
and Grandma&#8217;s heart was set on having the
biscuits just right. In you go, Olive.
Wait a minute, though, what about your
trunk?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have the check, Father,&#8221; Mrs. Horton
answered. &#8220;I thought Jimmie would be
coming down in the morning to the creamery.
He can get it then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; Mother brought her nightie in the
bag an&#8217; my pajamas,&#8221; contributed Sunny
Boy, waiting while Mother and the bag were
stowed away on the back seat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Want to ride up with me and help
drive?&#8221; said Grandpa, turning to him suddenly.</p>
<p>Poor Sunny Boy was sorely tempted, but
he decided quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have to take care of Mother,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;She might be lonesome all alone in the
back.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, indeed,&#8221; cried Mother instantly.
&#8220;You ride up there with Grandpa, precious.
You were so good not to tease about the
taxi. I&#8217;ll lean over the seat and talk to you
both.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Sunny Boy and Grandpa got into the
front seat, and Sunny learned that the
horses&#8217; names were Paul and Peter, and that
they were not afraid of automobiles, and
that he could drive them whenever some
older person was with him. Paul and
Peter trotted briskly along, and Grandpa
said they knew they were going home to supper.</p>
<p>They drove through the town, and Sunny
Boy thought it looked very cool, and clean,
and pretty, after the warm and dusty train.
The grass was bright green, and, as Sunny
Boy wrote Harriet, &#8220;millions and dozens&#8221; of
robins were singing among the trees. A
great red sun was going to bed back of a high
dark hill, and Sunny Boy, sitting beside
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
Grandpa and holding the reins while Paul
and Peter trotted steadily, thought that the
country was the nicest place he had ever
been in.</p>
<p>Then, where the road divided, Grandpa
took the reins and turned the team to the
left. They entered a lane with white-washed
fences on either side and tall waving trees
like soldiers, which Mrs. Horton said were
elms.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Sunny Boy,&#8221; she told him softly,
&#8220;here&#8217;s Brookside.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny Boy saw an old red brick house with
a great white porch across the front and a
green lawn all about it. A white picket
fence went all around the lawn, and as
Grandpa stopped the horses before the gate,
three people came out. There was a tall,
thin young man who went to the horses&#8217;
heads, a little girl with flaming red hair who
looked about fourteen years old, and a tall,
thin old lady with hair as white and curly as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
Grandpa&#8217;s, who came out to the carriage and
took Mother and Sunny Boy both in her
arms at once.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re Grandma,&#8221; said Sunny Boy.</p>
<p>It was Grandma Horton, and she remembered
Sunny Boy without a bit of trouble;
though, as he had been only two weeks old
the last time she had seen him, he could not
be expected to remember her.</p>
<p>&#8220;And this is Araminta,&#8221; said Grandma,
drawing the little red-haired girl forward.
&#8220;She is my right hand in the house. You
recall Jimmie, Olive?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jimmie was the young man holding the
horses. He came and shook hands with
Mrs. Horton, blushing a little, and chucked
Sunny under the chin. Then he took the
team away to the barn, and Mother and
Sunny Boy and Grandpa and Grandma
Horton and Araminta went in to supper.</p>
<p>They had wonderful fresh foamy milk to
drink, and hot biscuits and cold ham for the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
grown-ups. Sunny Boy was not expected
to eat those&mdash;not at night. There were
baked apples, too, and honey and cookies.
Sunny, seated before a bowl of bread and
milk, held a cookie in his hand and wondered
what was the matter with the hanging lamp
with the pretty red shade. It swung up and
down like a train lantern.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s sleepy,&#8221; he heard some one say. It
sounded like Araminta.</p>
<p>He opened his eyes as wide as he could
make them go, tried to take another bite of
cookie and made one last desperate effort to
smile. The smile ran into a yawn, and
Sunny Boy gave up and tumbled, a tired
little ball of weariness, into Mother&#8217;s lap.</p>
<p>He never knew who carried him upstairs,
or when he was undressed. So, waking in
the morning to find the sun shining in four
windows at once, and Mother in her blue
dressing gown brushing her hair, he was a bit
surprised.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; said Mother gayly. &#8220;How do
you think you are going to like the country?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are the chickens up?&#8221; asked Sunny
Boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hours ago. Mr. Rooster crowing under
our window woke me up at five o&#8217;clock,&#8221; replied
Mrs. Horton. &#8220;I heard Jimmie bring
in the milk a few minutes before you sat up.
And if you want to ride into town with him
after the trunk&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny Boy jumped out of bed and fairly
galloped with his dressing. He insisted on
using the wash bowl and pitcher, though
there was a nice white bathroom down the
hall, because a wash bowl and pitcher were
new to him. Just as he had finished brushing
his hair, Araminta rapped at the door to
tell them breakfast was ready.</p>
<p>In the dining room Sunny Boy met
another member of the family. Lying on a
rug in the corner was a shaggy brown and
white collie that rose as they came in and,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
coming over to Mrs. Horton, laid a beautiful
pointed nose in her lap.</p>
<p>&#8220;We shut him in the barn last night, because
we thought you&#8217;d be too tired to stand
his barking,&#8221; said Grandma. &#8220;His name is
Bruce, and he is very gentle. Don&#8217;t be
afraid of him, Sunny Boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>The collie went back to his rug while they
were at breakfast, but when Jimmie and
Sunny Boy started for the door he got up
to follow them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is he going, too?&#8221; asked Sunny Boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;He never goes off the farm,&#8221; answered
Jimmie. &#8220;He&#8217;ll follow us to the end of the
lane and then go back. Hop in lively, now,
for we&#8217;re late as it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jimmie had harnessed Peter to a wagon
that had only one high seat. In back of this
were two cans of milk which Jimmie explained,
in answer to Sunny&#8217;s questions,
would be made into butter at the creamery
in Cloverways.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Is Araminta your sister?&#8221; Sunny Boy
asked him as they jogged along.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, she&#8217;s the tenant farmer&#8217;s daughter&mdash;the
man who does the farming for your
Grandpa, you know. I work Spring and
Summer for him and in Winter I go to
the agricultural school. That&#8217;s where they
teach you to be a farmer.&#8221;</p>
<p>After they left the milk at the creamery
they drove down to the station and got the
trunk. Sunny Boy told Jimmie about the
alarm clock, and he laughed. Then, after
stopping at a yellow store with high white
steps, where Jimmie bought some groceries
for Grandma, they turned Peter&#8217;s head
toward home.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you going to do first?&#8221; asked
Jimmie, smiling down at his small companion.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know&mdash;what are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I have work to do&mdash;have to weed the
garden this morning. But you have the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
whole farm to get acquainted with. I&#8217;ll tell
you&mdash;if I were you, I&#8217;d go down to the brook
and play.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess I will,&#8221; decided Sunny Boy.</p>
<p>Mrs. Horton wanted to unpack the trunk,
and when Grandma assured her that the
brook was not deep and Sunny Boy promised
not to go wading until she should be there,
she kissed him and told him to run along and
have a good time.</p>
<p>On his way to the brook, Sunny Boy
passed Grandpa and Jimmie in wide straw
hats working in the garden. Grandpa
pointed out the brook to him. It ran
through a meadow that came right up to the
garden.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be down and play with you myself
as soon as we get this lettuce transplanted,&#8221;
said Grandpa.</p>
<p>Sunny had never had a brook to play in
before, and he thought it fine. It was not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
a very wide brook, but it was very clear, and
Sunny Boy could see the pebbles on the
bottom. Little darting fish went in and out,
hiding under the long grasses that leaned
over the edge. Bruce came panting down
as Sunny Boy looked at the water, and took
a long drink. Then he lay down in the
grass, his brown doggie eyes fixed watchfully
on his new friend.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wonder what that is?&#8221; said Sunny Boy
to himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8221; was a wooden wheel that turned
in the water with slow, even jerks, sending
out a little spray of rainbow drops that fell
back into the water. Sunny Boy got down
on his knees to watch it. Quite suddenly,
without warning, the wheel stopped turning.</p>
<p>Sunny Boy waited, but it did not turn
again. He blew on it gently, and still it did
not move. Then he ran over to the big tree
nearest him and picked up a stick.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll fix it,&#8221; he said aloud. &#8220;Grandpa&#8217;ll
be surprised if I get it mended &#8217;fore he
comes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, as it turned out, Grandpa was surprised,
but not as much as Sunny Boy. He
leaned over, and jabbed the obstinate wheel
with his stick; the dry end of the stake
snapped, and Sunny Boy, stick and all,
tumbled head-first into the water. In after
him leaped a flash of brown and white&mdash;good
old Bruce!</p>
<p>The water was very cold, and when Sunny
had swallowed some of it and shaken some
from his eyes, he scrambled to his feet crying
bitterly. He thought he was freezing to
death. Bruce pulled at his coat and tried to
drag him back, and it was his frantic barking
that attracted Jimmie&#8217;s notice. He came
tearing across the meadow, followed by
Grandpa.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&mdash;there&mdash;you&#8217;re all right,&#8221; said
Jimmie, as he pulled the little boy out in a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
jiffy. &#8220;Don&#8217;t cry so, Brother, you&#8217;re only
frightened. How&#8217;d it happen?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The wheel stopped!&#8221; sobbed Sunny Boy.
&#8220;An&#8217; I tried to fix it. I was going to s&#8217;prise
Grandpa.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So you did,&#8221; admitted Jimmie, while
Bruce circled around them, barking madly.
&#8220;Now we&#8217;ll have to look out that you don&#8217;t
surprise us more by catching cold from this
ducking.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>ADVENTURES BEGIN</h3>
</div>

<p>Grandpa hurried up to them, his
kind face filled with anxiety.</p>
<p>&#8220;I brought my coat,&#8221; he gasped, for he was
out of breath from running. &#8220;Wrap him in
that, Jimmie. Then hustle for the house.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jimmie carrying Sunny Boy and Grandpa
and Bruce following made quite a little procession.
Mrs. Horton, who was down at
the gate with Grandma inspecting the garden,
was startled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sunny Boy!&#8221; she cried, and came running
toward them. &#8220;What happened?
Are you hurt?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s all right,&#8221; Grandpa assured her
cheerfully. &#8220;Just fell into the brook and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
got a little damp, that&#8217;s all. Mercy, Olive,
don&#8217;t look like that&mdash;brooks were made for
boys to fall into. Why I&#8217;d dragged Harry
out a dozen times before he was Arthur&#8217;s
age.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course Mother and Grandma were relieved
and thankful to find it was nothing
more serious than a ducking. But they decided
that it was safer to rub Sunny Boy
briskly with towels and put him to bed to
rest.</p>
<p>&#8220;You might take cold and be sick a long
time, precious,&#8221; explained Mrs. Horton, as
she popped him between the sheets. &#8220;You
would miss all the Summer fun then. Now
close your eyes and Mother will read to
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>And while listening to the adventures of
a little Italian boy, Sunny&#8217;s blue eyes grew
heavier and heavier, till he went to sleep.</p>
<p>When he awoke, Mrs. Horton had gone,
and the room was empty and quiet. Sunny
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
Boy lay for a time, studying the walls and
furniture, for he had been asleep when put
to bed the night before and had dressed for
breakfast in such a hurry that he had not
noticed much of anything. It was a very
different room from his blue and white bedroom
at home, but a very pleasant, pretty
room, too. The wall-paper had gay little
pink roses scattered thickly over it, and the
furniture was all very large and dark and
brightly polished. Sunny Boy did not
know it, but the four-posted bed in which
he was lying had belonged to his great-grandmother,
and would be his own some
day.</p>
<p>Presently Sunny Boy tired of lying still
and began to be conscious of a funny sensation
somewhere down in his ribs. At least
he thought it must be his ribs. He remembered
that he had had no lunch. Did
his grandma expect him to starve at her
house?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span></p>
<p>Sunny Boy got up and found his slippers.
The &#8216;&#8217;fernal &#8217;chine&#8217; of an alarm clock was
ticking steadily away on the bureau where
Mrs. Horton had placed it after unpacking,
and with a great deal of trouble and much
tracing with a wet forefinger, he made out
that it was three o&#8217;clock&mdash;or was it five
o&#8217;clock? Three o&#8217;clock in the afternoon
and no lunch! Sunny Boy felt so sorry for
himself that he sat down on the floor and
wept a little. He was not quite awake yet,
you see, and our troubles often look rather
large when we first wake up. In just a minute
Sunny Boy stopped crying&mdash;he had
thought what to do.</p>
<p>Naturally his grandmother would not
wish him to go without eating all day, so
why not go down and try to find a little
chocolate cake, or some of those cookies left
from last night&#8217;s supper? Sunny Boy had
not the slightest idea where the pantry was,
but he was sure there must be one&mdash;every
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
house had a pantry with a cake box in it.
So, in his slippers and pink pajamas, he crept
out into the hall intent on locating the
pantry in Grandma Horton&#8217;s house.</p>
<p>He met no one on his way downstairs, and
the first floor of the house seemed deserted,
too. He couldn&#8217;t know that his mother and
Grandma had peeped in at him several times
and found him fast asleep, or that now they
were on the side porch entertaining a caller.
Jimmie and Grandpa were working in the
garden again, and Araminta had gone home
until it should be time to start supper. This
was why Sunny Boy found no one on his
path to the pantry. He found it without
great trouble, because he kept going until he
came to the kitchen, and a kitchen and the
pantry are never very far apart.</p>
<p>Grandma&#8217;s pantry was a beautiful place,
shelves and walls and floor a snowy white,
and boxes and jars in apple-pie order.
There was a large window with a table under
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
it, and there Grandma rolled her cookies and
made her pies, but Sunny Boy did not know
that yet. He spied a round box that, to his
experienced eyes, looked as though it might
hold cake.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get a chair,&#8221; he said aloud, talking to
himself, as he often did. &#8220;An&#8217; I won&#8217;t take
only a little piece. I wish I was bigger.&#8221;</p>
<p>He meant taller.</p>
<p>He carried in a kitchen chair and scrambled
up on it. His eyes were on a level with
the shelf, and there sat two beautiful brown
pies beside the cake box. Sunny poked a
small, fat finger into the nearest one to taste
it. It was very good, though he did not &#8220;remember&#8221;
the taste. My, how soury it was!
Grandma had baked two rhubarb pies. But
no pie could hold Sunny&#8217;s attention very
long&mdash;his heart was set on cake. Standing
on his tiptoes, he managed to lift the tin lid
of the box when a voice at the door startled
him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span></p>
<p>&#8220;My land of Goshen!&#8221; ejaculated Araminta.</p>
<p>Sunny Boy&#8217;s hand slipped, the lid came
down sharply on his fingers, and his other
hand swept across the shelf to knock over a
brown bowl from which some sticky yellow
stuff began to stream.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you&#8217;ve done it!&#8221; Araminta told
him. &#8220;That&#8217;s the custard pudding for to-morrow&#8217;s
dinner. What in the world are
you trying to do, anyway?&#8221;</p>
<p>Araminta was not accustomed to finding
small boys in pale pink pajamas standing
on chairs in her pantry, so no wonder she was
surprised. But she was kind, was Araminta,
and she helped Sunny Boy down, and did
not scold. She got a basin of clean water
and a clean cloth and wiped up the pudding
and washed Sunny&#8217;s hands for him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I came back an hour earlier than I had
to,&#8221; she told him, &#8220;&#8217;cause I thought maybe
you&#8217;d be up and might like to see the chicken
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
yard. No wonder you&#8217;re hungry if you
didn&#8217;t have any lunch. Your Grandma has
some saved for you on a big plate. I guess
they don&#8217;t know you&#8217;re up. You go and get
dressed, and I&#8217;ll warm it up for you. And
don&#8217;t say anything about knocking over the
custard&mdash;let &#8217;em think it was the cat.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny Boy was washed and dressed by the
time Mother came up again to see if he was
awake. She helped him a bit with his hair
and straightened his collar and kissed him
three or four times and then went down with
him to see him eat. Grandma did not call
it lunch&mdash;they had dinner and supper on the
farm.</p>
<p>Sunny Boy had a queer little feeling all
the while he was eating and he was so quiet
that his mother thought perhaps he was still
tired from his tumble into the brook. He
went out with Araminta afterward to see the
chicken yard, and he almost, but not quite,
forgot the queer feeling in watching the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
hundreds of white chickens and white ducks
busily scratching in the yard and drinking
water &#8220;upside down,&#8221; as he told Grandpa
that night. A chicken, you know, doesn&#8217;t
drink water as you do, but differently. Araminta
gave Sunny Boy a handful of cracked
corn to throw to the biddies, and they came
flocking about his feet, pushing and scrambling
so that he was glad when Araminta
shooed them away from him. She showed
him the nests, too, and in many of them were
pretty white eggs. He could gather them
some morning, all himself, Araminta told
him.</p>
<p>Coming out of the chicken yard they met
Jimmie, whistling merrily. He was glad to
find Sunny Boy all right after his wetting,
and asked him if he did not want to come
out to the stable to see Peter and Paul and
&#8220;the prettiest little fellows you ever saw.&#8221;
Sunny Boy went gladly, but the queer little
feeling went, too.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span></p>
<p>Peter and Paul, it seemed, lived in a house
that was called a barn, and were very comfortable.
They had each a little room, &#8220;box
stalls&#8221; Jimmie called them, and all the hay
they could eat. For breakfast and dinner
and supper they usually had corn and now
and then some oats. The barn was a delightful
place, and Jimmie pointed out the
hay mow when Sunny Boy mentioned that
Harriet had said that was the place to play
on rainy days.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not much hay in it now,&#8221; announced
Jimmie, leading the way into another little
room. &#8220;We start cutting this year&#8217;s crop
next week. Ever seen any one hay?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny Boy had not, but he forgot to say
so, because he found himself looking down
on a gentle-eyed collie dog mother with three
of the dearest little blind baby puppies you
could wish to see. Jimmie explained that
Lassie was Mrs. Bruce, and that the puppies
would have their eyes open in a day or two.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And one of them&#8217;s to be yours&mdash;your
Grandpa said so,&#8221; Jimmie went on.</p>
<p>And in spite of that&mdash;and what child
would not be pleased to have a puppy for his
very own?&mdash;the queer little feeling still
stayed with Sunny Boy. It was like a small
lump of lead right down at the end of his
throat.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going up to the house now for the
milk pails,&#8221; announced Jimmie, when they
had finished looking at the puppies. &#8220;You
can come out and watch me milk if you want
to.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the kitchen they found Mother and
Grandma.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let Topaz in,&#8221; said Grandma, as
Jimmie opened the door. &#8220;That wretched
cat has eaten half my egg custard, and I
won&#8217;t have him in the house again to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>Araminta was setting the table in the
dining room and did not hear. Sunny Boy
gulped a little, but spoke up bravely.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twasn&#8217;t Topaz, Grandma. I knocked
the custard over, looking for cake. I didn&#8217;t
mean to, but my hand slipped.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then how he did cry!</p>
<p>But when the whole story had come out,
and Grandma had hugged him, and had said
not to mind, that she could make another
pudding in a minute; after Mother had
whispered to him that while it was naughty
to help oneself to cake without asking, it was
much worse to let the kitty-cat be blamed,
and had kissed him and assured him she was
sure he would not do it again; after Araminta
had given him a pink peppermint&mdash;after
all this, and Sunny Boy was on his way
to the barn with Jimmie to watch the milking,
do you know, that queer little feeling
had entirely disappeared!</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>A LETTER FROM DADDY</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;My land of Goshen!&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny Boy sat on the fence post
waiting for the postman. He was great
friends now with the postman who came to
the farm, almost as great friends as with the
cheerful, gray-uniformed letter-carrier in the
city, the one who brought letters to the house
with the shining numbers that Harriet
faithfully polished.</p>
<p>This postman in the country did not wear
a uniform, and he came in a little red automobile
that one could hear chug-chugging
half a mile away. He did not whistle
either, as the city postman did, but he put
the letters and parcels into a tin box nailed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
to a post; then he turned up a little tin flag
to say that he had been there, and the farm
folk came down to the end of the lane and
got the mail. The country postman came
only once a day, instead of the three times
Sunny Boy was used to seeing the city postman,
but that really made it more exciting.</p>
<p>&#8220;My land of Goshen!&#8221; said Sunny Boy
again. He was rather proud of that expression,
and used it as often as he could.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you ought to say that,&#8221;
Araminta had reproved him the first time she
heard him.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you say it,&#8221; argued Sunny Boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s no reason why you should,&#8221;
retorted Araminta, who, like many grown-ups,
did not always practice what she
preached. &#8220;Anyway, I&#8217;m going to stop saying
it when I&#8217;m fifteen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe I will, too,&#8221; promised Sunny Boy
blithely. And that was the best Araminta
could hope from him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span></p>
<p>&#8220;My land&mdash;&#8221; began Sunny for the third
time, but the red automobile of the postman
came to a sliding stop beside the box, and
fortunately interrupted him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello Blue Jeans!&#8221; called the postman,
who found a new name for Sunny Boy every
day. &#8220;How do you like farming now?
Am I to give the mail to you, or put it in the
box?&#8221;</p>
<p>This was an every day question. The
postman pretended to be very much surprised
when Sunny Boy said he would take
the mail, and he always handed it out a piece
at a time, so that Sunny never knew how
much was coming.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s two for your grandfather,&#8221;
counted the postman, handing them to his
small friend standing on the running board.
&#8220;And that&#8217;s for your grandmother. Here&#8217;s
the Cloverways&#8217; weekly paper for the whole
family. My, my, one&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;five
seven letters, all for your mother. And a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
box, too. Is that all? Yep, guess that&#8217;s
all to-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny Boy got down from the running
board and the postman started his car
slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Mr. Corntassel!&#8221; the postman called
suddenly. &#8220;Here&#8217;s another. I declare, I
must be getting old, or need glasses, or something.
If there isn&#8217;t a letter addressed to
you and I came within one of taking it back
to the post-office with me!&#8221;</p>
<p>He gave Sunny Boy another letter, and
this time drove off without stopping.</p>
<p>&#8220;My land of Goshen!&#8221; said Sunny Boy,
who was using Araminta&#8217;s pet expression far
more often than she did. &#8220;Such a heap of
letters. Maybe mine&#8217;s from Daddy.&#8221;</p>
<p>He found Mrs. Horton in the porch
swing, sewing. She had to kiss the seven
new freckles on his nose before she could
read her mail, and then Sunny Boy had to
trudge about and find Grandpa and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
Grandma and deliver their letters to them.
He felt quite like a postman himself,
though it is doubtful if real postmen have
sugar cookies and peppermints paid to them
for each letter they bring. So by the time
Sunny Boy got around to having his own
letter read to him, Mother had finished hers
and had opened her box.</p>
<p>&#8220;See what Daddy sent us,&#8221; she said, holding
up the package for him to see. In the
box were two balls of pink wool and four of
dark blue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I can make you a sweater,&#8221; explained
Mrs. Horton. &#8220;The pink is for a
scarf I am finishing for Aunt Bessie. By
the way, I had a letter from her, dear, and
she sends her love, and so does Harriet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; agreed Sunny Boy briefly.
&#8220;Could you read this now, Mother?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, it&#8217;s from Daddy!&#8221; cried Mother,
taking the crumpled envelope Sunny Boy
drew from his pocket. &#8220;Did you wait till
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
you gave every one else his mail, precious?
Well, listen&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;Dear Sunny Boy,&#8221; said Daddy&#8217;s letter.
&#8220;So you fell into the brook! Don&#8217;t tell
Jimmie, but I did the same when I was just
about as tall as you are. Grandma fished
me out&mdash;only she wasn&#8217;t Grandma then.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go fishing till I come up, for you
might catch them all and leave none for me.
One week from the day you&#8217;re reading this
I&#8217;ll be at Brookside. Hope you and Jimmie
and Peter and Paul will come to meet me.
Mother, too, if she likes, and Grandpa and
Grandma and Araminta and Bruce, if
they&#8217;re going to be real glad to see me. You
seem to have a lot of friends. Brookside
always was a mighty fine place for small
boys&mdash;like you and me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t write more now because a man
wants to talk to me&mdash;at least he is ringing
my telephone bell and won&#8217;t stop. Love to
you and Mother from&mdash;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Daddy</span>.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<p>Whenever Sunny Boy was pleased he
made a little song to sing. He did so now,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
skipping out to the garden where Grandpa
was generally to be found.</p>
<p>&#8220;Daddy&#8217;s coming! Daddy&#8217;s coming!
Next week! Pretty soon,&#8221; sang Sunny Boy
to a tune of his own. &#8220;Jimmie, where&#8217;s
Grandpa? Daddy&#8217;s coming next week,
pretty soon!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well don&#8217;t walk all over the cabbage
plants if he is,&#8221; said Jimmie, who was busy
and did not like to be interrupted. &#8220;I think
your grandfather is down with Mr. Sites
looking at the mowing machine. They&#8217;re
down in the south meadow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny Boy knew his way about the farm
as well as Jimmie by this time. He knew
the pretty brown cow, Mrs. Butterball and
her long legged calf, Butterette; and he was
fast friends with Peter and Paul and the
dogs. Sunny had named his puppy
Brownie. He knew most of the chickens
and ducks by names of his own, and he had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
held a little squirmy lamb in his arms for a
minute, with Jimmie helping. He was going
fishing, when Daddy came; and he was
going up into the woods the first time some
one had a moment to take him. Then he
would have been all over the farm.</p>
<p>Still singing to himself, he trotted down
to the south meadow and found Grandpa
and a strange man talking earnestly together.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look out! Stay where you are!&#8221; called
the strange man suddenly. &#8220;Back, Bruce,
back!&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny Boy stopped instantly. So did
Bruce, who had followed him. Neither the
little boy nor the dog could see why they
should be shouted at, but they obeyed without
question. And in a minute they saw a
very good reason why. The stranger talking
to Grandpa bent down and lifted a
handle on a queer looking machine, and right
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
out of the grass&mdash;where no one could have
seen it&mdash;rose a long ugly thing that looked
like a big saw.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Sunny Boy!&#8221; called Grandpa.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked Sunny, eyeing the
long saw curiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the mowing machine. We&#8217;re going
to cut hay with it presently,&#8221; answered
Grandpa. &#8220;Sites, this is Harry&#8217;s son.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Sites shook hands with Sunny Boy,
smiling down at him cheerfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t say!&#8221; he drawled. &#8220;Well,
youngster, your father and I went to school
together. When&#8217;s he coming up? I&#8217;d like
to see him again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Daddy&#8217;s coming next week, pretty
soon,&#8221; sang Sunny Boy, capering about the
mowing machine joyously. &#8220;He wrote me
a letter. May I sit on it, Grandpa?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny meant the seat of the mowing machine,
and Grandpa lifted him in and held
him while Mr. Sites harnessed up a pair of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
fat white horses and Mr. Hatch appeared
from somewhere. Sunny Boy was acquainted
with Mr. Hatch. He was Araminta&#8217;s
father and did most of the farming
for Grandpa. The Hatches lived in a
yellow house down the road, and Araminta
had six little brothers and sisters with whom
Sunny sometimes played. So you see he
was not lonely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now we&#8217;ll go over to the fence,&#8221; said
Grandpa, lifting him down, &#8220;and watch how
the grass is cut. That saw-thing is the
knife, and you must never go near a mowing
machine unless you can see the knife sticking
up. Little boys and dogs, and even
men, can be very easily hurt if they are careless
and don&#8217;t watch the knife.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Grandpa and Mr. Sites and Sunny Boy
sat on the fence and Bruce lay down at their
feet, while Mr. Hatch rode on the mowing
machine round and round the field. The
fat white horses did not hurry in the least,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
but a wide light green path marked where
the grass was being cut. Grandpa explained
that when the sun had dried this
grass it was called hay, and that Peter and
Paul liked it to eat and to make their beds of
in the winter. He promised Sunny Boy
that he should help rake the hay the next
afternoon.</p>
<p>Whr-rr! purred the mowing machine as
Mr. Hatch turned and the fat white horses
came toward them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whoa!&#8221; the horses stopped suddenly.</p>
<p>Up came the long saw-knife, and Mr.
Hatch jumped down from his seat and bent
over, looking at something on the ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s found something,&#8221; said Mr. Sites to
Grandpa. &#8220;Wonder if it is&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, Sunny! Sunny Boy! Oh, Sunny
Boy!&#8221; Mr. Hatch waved his big straw hat
wildly. &#8220;Come and see what I&#8217;ve got.
Make Bruce stay there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll hold Bruce,&#8221; said Mr. Sites. &#8220;You
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
two go on over. I&#8217;ll bet a cookie I know
what he&#8217;s found.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny Boy raced over the meadow, dragging
Grandpa by the hand. Mr. Hatch
had looked very near, but it was a very wide
meadow if you tried to run across it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurry,&#8221; sputtered Sunny Boy, red in the
face with the excitement and heat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Am hurrying,&#8221; grunted Grandpa.
&#8220;You seem to forget about the bone in my
leg!&#8221;</p>
<p>But Sunny Boy was too eager to see what
Mr. Hatch had found to be sorry even for a
grandfather with a bone in his leg.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>SUNNY BOY FORGETS</h3>
</div>

<p>When they reached the horses and
the machine, the Something was
around on the other side.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, Sunny Boy, here&#8217;s a sight for you,&#8221;
said Mr. Hatch mysteriously. &#8220;What do
you think of this?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny Boy bent down to look. There, in
a hole in the ground, half-hidden by the tall
grass all about it, were four little furry baby
rabbits!</p>
<p>&#8220;Bunnies!&#8221; and Sunny plunged his two
hands down into the middle of that furry
bunch.</p>
<p>They snuggled closer, and their soft eyes
looked frightened, but they did not try to
run away.</p>

He lifted one of the baby rabbits and placed it in Sunny&#8217;s hands.<br />

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s their mamma?&#8221; demanded
Sunny Boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;The mower scared her off,&#8221; said Mr.
Hatch. &#8220;Pick one up&mdash;you won&#8217;t hurt it&mdash;see,
like this.&#8221;</p>
<p>He lifted one of the baby rabbits and
placed it in Sunny&#8217;s hands. It wriggled uneasily,
and he let it fall back into the nest.
Mr. Hatch and Grandpa laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll leave them right here,&#8221; declared
Mr. Hatch kindly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll mow around the
nest, but not very near, and I guess the
mother rabbit will come back to-night.
Funny creatures, aren&#8217;t they? Every year
they have a nest in a grass field, and every
year I come within an ace of cutting off their
noses.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny Boy and Bruce wandered back to
the house alone. Grandpa was busy overhauling
more machinery with Mr. Sites, and
Jimmie was still busy with cabbages.
Sunny was used to so much attention that he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
felt rather put out when Araminta, sweeping
the front porch, told him that Mother
and Grandma had taken Peter and the
buggy and had driven to Cloverways.</p>
<p>&#8220;They said I could go next time,&#8221; grumbled
Sunny Boy, not a bit sunnily.
&#8220;Mother said so. &#8217;Tain&#8217;t fair.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t say &#8217;tain&#8217;t,&#8221; corrected Araminta,
who was very careful of Sunny&#8217;s grammar.
&#8220;Say it isn&#8217;t fair. Only it is&mdash;how could
you go when you were down in the field with
your grandpa?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny Boy felt that if Araminta had deserted
him, there was no friend left. He
went on into the house and wept a little,
curled up in the big leather chair in the
sitting room. He felt very sorry for himself.</p>
<p>But even a little boy whose mother and
grandmother have gone away and left him
can not feel sorry very long when a June
breeze is ruffling the white curtains at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
window and there is a whole farm ready and
waiting for him to come out and play. After
a few big raindrop tears and a sniff or two,
Sunny Boy wiped his eyes on his &#8220;hanky,&#8221;
and decided that he would be brave and
cheerful and then perhaps his family would
be sorry to think how they had treated him.</p>
<p>He decided to make a kite and go out and
fly it, the wind at the window making him
think of kite-flying and the sight of a mass of
papers on Grandpa&#8217;s desk in one corner of
the room suggesting what to make the kite
of. He went over to the desk and climbed
upon the chair standing before it.</p>
<p>Ordinarily Sunny Boy had a good
memory. He could remember things for
Mother and he seldom forgot where he had
left his toys, but this morning a strange
thing happened&mdash;his memory did not work
at all. He forgot completely that Mother
had told him not to touch other people&#8217;s
things without permission and that books
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
and papers were not to be opened or even unfolded
unless one first asked.</p>
<p>Sunny Boy thrust a hand down among the
papers on Grandpa&#8217;s desk and pulled out
two nice smooth brown pieces of paper that
seemed strong and just exactly right for a
kite. For good measure he took a letter or
two, and then scurried out to the kitchen for
string.</p>
<p>He had never made a kite, but he had
often watched the boys in the park at home
flying them, and he had a very good idea of
how they were made. He had his own
bottle of paste Mother had brought for him
and he found the kind of sticks he wanted
out in the yard. In half an hour he had the
papers pasted smoothly over the sticks, a
wiggly tail of crumpled papers from the
waste-basket tied on, and yards and yards
of string wound on a piece of wood. Sunny
Boy was ready to sail his kite.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span></p>
<p>Araminta gave him a cookie and advised
him to go down by the brook.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s more breeze there,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;But for mercy&#8217;s sake don&#8217;t fall in again.
And come in when you hear me ring the
bell.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny Boy trudged down to the brook and
started running with his kite as he had seen
the boys do, to give it a good start. Up, up,
it went, sailing high over his head, the
crumpled paper tail wiggling in the wind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jus&#8217; as good,&#8221; said Sunny Boy to himself,
&#8220;jus&#8217; as good.&#8221;</p>
<p>He meant to say &#8220;Just as good as Archie
Johnson&#8217;s,&#8221; Archie being one of the older
boys who played in the park and who sailed
elaborate kites. But Sunny had not tied the
knots in his string tightly enough, and a
strong puff of wind coming by, the cord
parted and away sailed the kite, over the
brook and into the woods!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Ding-ling! Ding-ling! Ding-a-ling!&#8221;
rang Araminta&#8217;s bell.</p>
<p>It is often a good thing to be too busy to
cry. Sunny Boy might have felt bad over
the loss of his kite&mdash;indeed he watched it
out of sight&mdash;but if he meant to cry the
sound of the bell changed his mind. Instead,
he ran up to the house as fast as he
could go, and found Mother and Grandma
waiting for him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you miss us?&#8221; asked his mother.
&#8220;We knew you were having a good time,
dear. Grandma has brought you a lolly-pop.
What have you been doing to get so
sun-burned?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Flying kites,&#8221; stated Sunny Boy.
&#8220;Thank you, Grandma. We found bunnies
down in the field.&#8221;</p>
<p>Grandpa came on the porch then, his
glasses pushed up on his forehead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mary, Olive, have either of you seen
anything of those two five hundred dollar
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
bonds I had on my desk?&#8221; he said anxiously.
&#8220;They were there this morning, and when I
came in from the mowing I couldn&#8217;t find
them. Have either of you used my desk?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Father,&#8221; said Mrs. Horton.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Arthur,&#8221; said Grandma. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure
Araminta hasn&#8217;t been near the desk, either.
Sunny, you weren&#8217;t in the sitting room this
morning, were you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I was,&#8221; chirped Sunny Boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you didn&#8217;t see anything of Grandpa&#8217;s
bonds&mdash;his nice beautiful, Liberty
Bonds, did you, dear?&#8221; asked Mrs. Horton.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Grandpa sighed, and turned to
go in, &#8220;I&#8217;ll look more thoroughly, of
course. But they&#8217;re gone&mdash;I&#8217;m sure of it.
I had no business to be so careless. They
should have been in the bank a week ago.
They might have blown out of the window&mdash;I&#8217;ll
see that a screen goes in that window
to-night.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span></p>
<p>Sunny Boy put down his lolly-pop and
followed Grandpa into the house. He
found him seated at the desk, the papers in
great confusion all about him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Sunny, did you come to help me
hunt?&#8221; asked Grandpa. &#8220;Don&#8217;t bother
your yellow head about it. When you
grow up, try to be more careful than your
grandfather.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny Boy slipped a warm little hand
into Grandpa&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;I made a kite&mdash;with papers,&#8221; he confessed
bravely. &#8220;Not Lib&#8217;ty Bonds, Grandpa,
just papers on top of your desk. I was
&#8217;musing myself, and I had to have a kite.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; said Grandpa slowly, and not a
bit crossly. &#8220;What color paper, dear?
White?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, brown,&#8221; replied Sunny Boy eagerly,
sure now that he had not taken the missing
bonds. &#8220;Just brown, Grandpa, and two old
letters.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ve copies of those&mdash;they don&#8217;t
matter,&#8221; said Grandpa. &#8220;But we&#8217;d better
get that kite, Namesake, because you&#8217;ve
pasted my bonds on it, and a thousand dollars
is a bit too expensive a kite even for my
one and only grandson.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it flew off!&#8221; Sunny Boy began to cry.
&#8220;The string broke, an&#8217; it went over the brook
into the woods.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Horton, coming into the sitting room
to remind Sunny Boy to wash his face and
hands before dinner, found her little boy
crying as though his heart would break in
Grandpa&#8217;s arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;What in the world&mdash;&#8221; she began.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&mdash;there&mdash;it&#8217;s all right,&#8221; soothed
Grandpa. &#8220;We&#8217;re in a peck of trouble,
Olive, because we took some papers from
Grandpa&#8217;s desk to make a kite with and now
they turn out to be two Liberty Bonds.
And the kite&mdash;like the pesky contrivance it
is&mdash;got away and is hiding somewhere in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
woods. But we&#8217;re going out right after
dinner and hunt for it, aren&#8217;t we, Sunny
Boy?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny Boy felt Mother&#8217;s kind hand
smoothing his hair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, my dear little boy!&#8221; said Mother&#8217;s
voice. &#8220;My dear little son! How could
you? Didn&#8217;t you know how wrong it was
to touch a single thing on Grandpa&#8217;s desk?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I forgot,&#8221; said Sunny Boy in a very little
voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why I wouldn&#8217;t have believed that my
Sunny Boy could forget,&#8221; grieved Mother.
&#8220;And now Grandpa&#8217;s money is lost! And
Daddy coming next week! What will he
say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to find it long before Daddy
comes,&#8221; said Grandpa stoutly. &#8220;Right
after dinner we&#8217;re going over to the woods.
Sunny can remember about where he thinks
the kite fell. Cheer up, Olive&mdash;we&#8217;re sorry
we didn&#8217;t remember about &#8216;hands off&#8217; when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
other people&#8217;s property is about, but every
one forgets once in a while. And I was careless&mdash;I&#8217;m
as great a sinner as Sunny. And
now forgive us both before we&#8217;re quite
drowned in our tears.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mother and Sunny Boy had another little
cry all to themselves upstairs and he told her
that never, <i>never</i> would he touch anything
that did not belong to him again without
first asking. Then they both bathed their
faces in clear cold water and felt better.
No one mentioned bonds at dinner, and there
was strawberry short-cake which Sunny Boy
declared was as good as his favorite chocolate
ice cream. And right after dinner he
and Grandpa went out to hunt for the lost
kite.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>GOING FISHING</h3>
</div>

<p>But though Grandpa and Sunny Boy
hunted and hunted and hunted, till it
seemed as though they must have covered
every inch of the big woods; though they
searched the tangled thickets where the
briery blackberry bushes grew along the edge
of the brook; though they looked up at the
trees till their necks ached, hoping perhaps
to find the kite caught in the branches; still
they had to come home without the precious
Liberty Bonds.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; said Grandpa, as they
made their way toward home over a little
pathway of stones tumbled together in the
brook to make a bridge, &#8220;Never mind,
Sunny. If we can&#8217;t find them, we can&#8217;t,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
and there is no use in feeling bad about it
any longer. You didn&#8217;t mean to lose the
bonds, we all know that, so we&#8217;ll just stop
crying over spilled milk and cheer up and be
happy again.&#8221;</p>
<p>But it was a very unhappy little boy who
went to bed early that night&mdash;for the long
tramp had tired him&mdash;and for several days
after the loss of the kite Sunny Boy kept
rather closely to the house.</p>
<p>He liked to be in the kitchen with Araminta
or on the side porch with Grandma
and Mother. Jimmie and Bruce tried to
coax him to go with them, but he said politely
that he didn&#8217;t feel like it.</p>
<p>However, as the time drew near for his
father&#8217;s visit Sunny Boy cheered up, and by
the morning that Daddy was expected he
felt quite like his usually sunny self.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you going to meet Daddy?&#8221; he asked
Mother that morning, as he brushed his hair
after she had parted it for him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe I&#8217;ll go down,&#8221; answered
Mrs. Horton. &#8220;If you and Grandpa go,
that will be enough and I&#8217;ll be at the gate
waiting for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Daddy&#8217;s coming!&#8221; Sunny Boy pounded
his spoon against his bread and milk bowl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sunny!&#8221; said Mother warningly.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s most here now!&#8221; and Sunny&#8217;s feet
hammered against the table so that the coffee
pot danced a jig.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sunny Boy!&#8221; implored Grandma.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to meet him!&#8221; This time
Sunny Boy upset his glass of water with a
wild sweep of his arm.</p>
<p>Grandpa pushed back his chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we&#8217;d better start,&#8221; he observed,
&#8220;before a certain young man goes out of the
window. If you&#8217;re as glad as all this to
think that Daddy&#8217;s coming, what are you
going to do when you really see him?&#8221;</p>
<p>But Sunny Boy was already out of the
room and down at the gate where Jimmie
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
stood holding Peter and Paul already harnessed
to the carryall.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me feed &#8217;em sugar,&#8221; teased Sunny
Boy. &#8220;Hold me up, Jimmie, I&#8217;m not &#8217;fraid
of their teeth now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You pile in,&#8221; said Jimmie good-naturedly.
&#8220;If you&#8217;re going to meet that
train, you want to start in a few minutes.
Say, Sunny, what ails you this morning?&#8221;
for Sunny Boy had gone around to the back
of the carriage, scrambled up over the top
of the second seat, and was now tumbling
head first into the cushions of the front seat.</p>
<p>Grandpa came out in a more leisurely
fashion and took the reins.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Jimmie, we&#8217;re off. In case
anything happens to the team, Sunny has
enough push in him this morning to pull the
carriage there and back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Peter and Paul trotted briskly, and
Sunny&#8217;s tongue kept pace with their heels.
His shrill little voice was the first thing Mr.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
Horton heard, for the train had beaten them
to the station after all, and as the carriage
turned the corner of the street a familiar figure
stood on the platform waving to them.
Grandpa had to keep one hand on his grandson
to prevent him from falling out over the
wheels.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well, Son, isn&#8217;t this fine!&#8221; Daddy
had him in his arms almost before the horses
stopped. &#8220;How brown you are! and yes,
you&#8217;ve grown, too. I&#8217;ll put the suitcase in&mdash;don&#8217;t
try to lift it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Daddy put Sunny Boy down and turned
and kissed Grandpa.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re his little boy!&#8221; Sunny thought
out loud. It was the first time he had
thought about it at all.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m his daddy,&#8221; said Grandpa proudly.
&#8220;Pretty fine boy, all things considered, isn&#8217;t
he?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny Boy laughed because this was probably
a joke. Anyway, Grandpa laughed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
and so did Daddy. Then they all got into
the carriage and Daddy drove Peter and
Paul. How Mrs. Horton laughed when
she saw them drive up to the gate, all three
of them crowded together on the front seat.</p>
<p>&#8220;You three big boys!&#8221; she teased them.
&#8220;I suppose you had so much to talk about
that you had to be together.&#8221;</p>
<p>Daddy put one arm around Mother and
the other about Grandma.</p>
<p>&#8220;Make the most of me,&#8221; he said gayly.
&#8220;I can stay only three days.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then there was a great to-do. Mother
and Grandma had counted on having him
for three weeks. Three days, as Mother
said, was &#8220;no vacation at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But better than nothing,&#8221; Mr. Horton
pointed out. &#8220;We can do a great deal in
three days. And if I can&#8217;t get up again, at
least I&#8217;ll come up to get you and Sunny
when you&#8217;re ready to go home.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, being sensible people and not given
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
to &#8220;crying over spilled milk&#8221; (which was
Grandpa&#8217;s favorite proverb) they soon decided
to enjoy every minute of Daddy&#8217;s stay
and to begin right away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sunny and I are going fishing,&#8221; announced
Daddy firmly. &#8220;We&#8217;ll go to-day&mdash;if
Araminta can give us a lunch&mdash;and
Mother is coming with us, if she wants to.
Then to-morrow she and I are going for a
long drive, and the last day I&#8217;m going to be
a farmer and help Father with the work.
Come on, Sunny, upstairs with you and get
on high shoes. We don&#8217;t go fishing in sandals
and socks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Araminta made them sandwiches and
packed a box of lunch, putting in a whole
apple pie. Daddy had brought his fishing
rod with him, and he promised to make
Sunny one as soon as they found a place to
fish. Mother thought she would not go, for
she was already tired from a long walk the
day before. So Sunny Boy and Daddy set
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
off alone for the brook in the woods where
the speckled trout lived.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall I catch one?&#8221; asked Sunny Boy,
scuffling along. He did like to scuffle his
feet and Daddy did not seem to care how
much noise he made. &#8220;Shall I fish?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure you&#8217;ll fish,&#8221; Daddy assured him.
&#8220;Likely, you&#8217;ll catch one, though you never
can tell. A good sportsman doesn&#8217;t growl
even if he spends a whole day and doesn&#8217;t
catch one fish. We&#8217;ll be good sports, shan&#8217;t
we?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; agreed Sunny Boy. &#8220;But I
would rather catch a fish.&#8221;</p>
<p>Daddy laughed and began to whistle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know Jimmie?&#8221; said Sunny Boy,
running to keep up with him. &#8220;Do you
know Jimmie and Mr. Sites and Araminta
and David and Raymond and Juddy and
Fred and Sarah and Dorabelle? Do you,
Daddy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I went to school with a boy named Jaspar
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
Sites,&#8221; Daddy stopped whistling to answer.
&#8220;Guess he&#8217;s the same. Araminta
helps Grandma&mdash;I know her, and Jimmie
I&#8217;ve met before. But I must say the others
haven&#8217;t the pleasure of my acquaintance&mdash;who
is Dorabelle, may I ask?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re Araminta&#8217;s brothers and sisters,&#8221;
explained Sunny Boy. &#8220;They live
down the road. Let&#8217;s fish now, Daddy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We will,&#8221; agreed Mr. Horton.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve picked out a good place. Now
first I&#8217;ll start you in, and then I&#8217;ll try my
luck.&#8221;</p>
<p>He found a nice long branch for Sunny,
and tied a fish-line to it. At the end of the
line he fastened a bent pin with a bit of
cracker on the point.</p>
<p>&#8220;There you are,&#8221; he told him. &#8220;Now you
sit out here on the dead roots of this tree
that hangs over the bank, and you dangle
the cracker in the water and keep very, very
still. And perhaps a little fish on his way
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
to the grocery store for his mother will see
the cracker and want a bite of lunch. Then
you&#8217;ll catch him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny Boy sat very still while Daddy
baited a sharp thin hook with real bait and
threw his line into the water, too. He sat
down beside Sunny and together they
waited.</p>
<p>&#8220;Daddy!&#8221; said Sunny Boy after a long
while.</p>
<p>Mr. Horton raised a warning finger.</p>
<p>&#8220;But Daddy?&#8221; this after Sunny Boy had
waited a longer time.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll scare the fish,&#8221; Mr. Horton whispered.
&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My foot prickles!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Horton took his line and whispered
to him to get up and run about.</p>
<p>Sunny Boy&#8217;s foot felt too funny for words,
and at first he was sure it had dropped off
while he had been sitting on it. He could
not feel it at all. After stamping up and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
down a few minutes the funny feeling went
away, and he came back to his father and
took his line.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your foot was asleep,&#8221; said Mr. Horton
in a low tone. &#8220;Don&#8217;t sit on it again.
Feel a nibble?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny Boy drew his line up and looked
at it. There was nothing at all on the pin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Percy Perch must have taken that cracker
when you weren&#8217;t looking,&#8221; said Mr. Horton,
putting another cracker on. &#8220;Now
watch out that Tommy Trout doesn&#8217;t run
off with this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny Boy waited and waited. A yellow
butterfly came and sat down on a blade of
grass near him. Sunny looked at it more
closely&mdash;it was a funny butterfly&mdash;a funny
butter&mdash;</p>
<p>Splash went his rod and line, but he never
heard it. Sunny Boy was fast asleep, and
Tommy Trout must have run away with the
pin and the cracker because they were never
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
heard of again. When Sunny Boy opened
his eyes again, his father was folding up his
fishing tackle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello! You&#8217;re a great fisherman!&#8221;
Daddy greeted him. &#8220;See what we&#8217;re going
to take home to Mother to surprise her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny Boy rubbed his sleepy eyes.
There on the grass lay four pretty little fish.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you catch them?&#8221; he asked Daddy,
who nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;My land of Goshen!&#8221; said Sunny Boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;d you pick that up?&#8221; demanded
Daddy. &#8220;Do you think apple pie might
help you to feel spryer?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny Boy was interested in pie, and he
helped Daddy to spread the little white cloth
on the ground. He had not known a picnic
was part of the fun of fishing!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>THE HAY SLIDE</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Daddy,&#8221; said Sunny Boy, as he
munched a sandwich, lying on his
stomach and looking down into the brook
from the safe height of the bank, &#8220;how much
is five hundred dollars?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A large sum of money,&#8221; answered Mr.
Horton, surprised. &#8220;Why, Son? What
do you know about such things? Little
boys shouldn&#8217;t be bothering about money for
years and years to come.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Sunny told him about Grandpa&#8217;s
bonds and how he had lost them by pasting
them on his kite. Mr. Horton was very
sorry, but he said little.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only remember this, Sunny Boy,&#8221; he insisted
gravely. &#8220;I would rather you told
me yourself than to have heard it from any
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
one else&mdash;even from Mother. When
you&#8217;ve done anything good or bad that you
think I should know, you tell me yourself,
always. And now how about going wading?&#8221;</p>
<p>That was great fun. Sunny Boy rolled
his trousers up as far as they would go and
took off his shoes and stockings. The water
was not deep, but, my! wasn&#8217;t it cold?
Little baby fish darted in and out, and ever
so many times Sunny thought he had a handful
of them. But when he unclosed his
hands there was never anything in them but
water, and not much of that.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I did catch a fish, could I keep him,
Daddy?&#8221; Sunny asked. &#8220;I could carry
home some brook for him to live in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny meant some of the brook water.
Daddy explained that the baby fish, minnows
they are called, would not be happy
living in a bowl as the goldfish Sunny once
had were.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And you wouldn&#8217;t want a fish to be unhappy,
would you?&#8221; questioned Daddy.
&#8220;Of course you wouldn&#8217;t. But I&#8217;ll tell you
something better to do than trying to catch
fish that only want to be left alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Something to do with my shoes and stockings
off?&#8221; stipulated Sunny anxiously. &#8220;I
haven&#8217;t been wading hardly a minute yet,
Daddy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Daddy laughed a little. He was lying
flat on his stomach as Sunny had done, peering
over the bank down at the water. He
seemed to be having a very good time, did
Daddy.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is something you can do without
your shoes and stockings,&#8221; he assured the
small figure standing in the middle of the
brook. &#8220;Indeed, I thought of it because
you are all fixed for doing it. You know
Mother was talking about her Christmas
presents last night?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny nodded.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span></p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s sewing a bag for Aunt Bessie,&#8221; he
confided, &#8220;and Grandma is getting ready,
too. But I think Christmas is about a year
off, Daddy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a year&mdash;about five months,&#8221; corrected
Daddy. &#8220;That seems like a long
time to you. But Mother likes to start early
and make many of her presents. And a
very good way it is, too. Well, Sunny Boy,
I once heard Mother say that she would like
to try making an indoor garden for some of
her friends who live in apartments and have
no gardens of their own. Only, Mother
said, she must experiment first and find out
what would grow best.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s an indoor garden?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, there are different kinds,&#8221; answered
Daddy. &#8220;But I think the kind Mother is
anxious to try is very simple. Just damp
moss and a vine or two put into a glass bowl.
They will grow and keep green all Winter
and be pretty to look at.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I could get her some moss,&#8221; said Sunny
quickly. &#8220;See, those stones are all covered,
Daddy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just what I want you to do,&#8221;
agreed Daddy. &#8220;We&#8217;ll take plenty home
to Mother and she can experiment with indoor
gardens to her heart&#8217;s content. See,
Son, here&#8217;s my knife. You must cut the
moss very carefully in square pieces, and try
not to break it. I&#8217;ll be digging up some of
these healthy little ground vines.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny Boy was proud to be allowed to
handle Daddy&#8217;s big jack knife, and he was
glad Daddy hadn&#8217;t told him not to cut
himself. Daddy, somehow, always trusted
Sunny not to be heedless.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother&#8217;ll like it, won&#8217;t she?&#8221; he called
to Daddy, who was digging up a pretty,
creeping green vine that grew in the grass
near him. &#8220;Won&#8217;t she be s&#8217;prised,
Daddy?&#8221;</p>
<p>They worked busily, and soon Sunny had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
a neat little pile of green moss ready to take
home to Mother. After that he waded
about in the brook, splashing the water with
his bare feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&mdash;you&#8217;ve been in long enough,&#8221;
called Mr. Horton presently. &#8220;The water
is too cold to play in it long. Come, Son,
and put on your shoes and stockings.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny Boy dabbled his feet in a little hole
made by a stone he had pushed away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sunny Boy!&#8221; called Mr. Horton once
again.</p>
<p>Still Sunny Boy continued to play in the
water. To tell the truth every one had been
so anxious to make him happy at Brookside
that he was the least little bit in the world
spoiled. The more you have your own way,
you know, the harder it is to do other people&#8217;s
way, and if you can do as you please
day after day, by and by you want to do as
you please all the time. Sunny Boy felt
like that now.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Sunny!&#8221; said Daddy a third time, very
quietly.</p>
<p>Sunny Boy looked at him&mdash;and came
marching out of the water. He was not
very pleasant while Daddy helped him dry
his feet and get into the despised shoes and
stockings, but, when they were ready to start
for home and Daddy tilted up his chin to
look at him squarely, Sunny Boy&#8217;s own smile
came out.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right!&#8221; announced Daddy cheerfully.
&#8220;Let&#8217;s go home a different way and
perhaps we&#8217;ll find wild strawberries.&#8221;</p>
<p>They did, too, a patch of them down at
one end of the apple orchard, and Mr. Horton
showed Sunny Boy how he used to string
them on grass stems to take home to his
mother when he was a little boy.</p>
<p>He certainly was a dear Daddy, and when
he went back to the city Mother and Sunny
had to be nicer to each other than ever because
they missed him so very much.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s raining!&#8221; Sunny Boy stood at the
window after breakfast, the morning after
Mr. Horton had gone back to the city.
&#8220;Does it rain in the summer?&#8221;</p>
<p>Grandma laughed, and told him that indeed
it did rain in the summer.</p>
<p>&#8220;We haven&#8217;t had a drop of rain since
you&#8217;ve been here, and you must have brought
fair weather with you,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Now
that the hay is all in the barn, we&#8217;re glad to
see it rain, for the garden needs it badly.
Think how thirsty the flowers and vegetables
must be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Harriet said to play in the barn on rainy
days,&#8221; said Sunny Boy sadly, &#8220;but I think
I&#8217;m lonesome.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you go out to the barn and you
won&#8217;t be lonesome,&#8221; Araminta, who was
clearing the breakfast table, laughed at his
long face. &#8220;I&#8217;ll bet all the children are
there, even the baby. He can go, can&#8217;t he,
Mrs. Horton?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span></p>
<p>Grandma said yes, of course he could, and
Mother brought his rubbers and raincoat
downstairs when she came, for he met her
on the stairs and there she had them all
ready.</p>
<p>&#8220;Run along and have a good time,&#8221; she
told him, kissing him. &#8220;I was going to suggest
that you play in the barn this morning.
Help Jimmie if he&#8217;s working, won&#8217;t you, and
don&#8217;t hinder him?&#8221;</p>
<p>Paddling out to the barn in the pouring
rain was fun. But the barn was the most
fun of all. Grandpa and Jimmie were on
the first floor mending harness, and the doors
were open so that they could see right out
into the orchard and yet not get a bit wet.
Just as Araminta had said, all the Hatch
children were there, even the baby, who lay
asleep on the hay in a nice, quiet corner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurrah!&#8221; cried Juddy Hatch. &#8220;We&#8217;re
going to play robbers, and you can be in my
cave.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Be in my cave,&#8221; urged David, his
brother. &#8220;Our side has the best slide.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll come up there and settle you youngsters
if you&#8217;re going to quarrel,&#8221; threatened
Jimmie, switching a buggy whip and looking
very fierce. &#8220;You&#8217;d better start playing
and stop arguing.&#8221;</p>
<p>The children knew Jimmie had small patience
with little bickerings, though he had
never been known to do anything more severe
than scold. So they took him at his
word and began to play.</p>
<p>&#8220;You be on Juddy&#8217;s side, then,&#8221; agreed
David. &#8220;See, we each have a cave here in
the hay&mdash;that&#8217;s mine in this corner. The
way we do is to all go into our caves and
take turns creeping up. When you hear us
on the roof of your cave, you have to get out
and run over to ours, climb up to the top and
slide down the other side. If you&#8217;re caught
you have to b&#8217;long to our robber tribe.&#8221;</p>
<p>The hay was very smooth and slippery,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
and the children had many a tumble as the
two robber tribes chased each other across
the haymow. Such shrieks of laughter, such
howls as the robbers in their excitement
sometimes forgot and pulled a braid of
Sarah&#8217;s or Dorabelle&#8217;s! The baby continued
to sleep placidly through all the noise,
and Jimmie told Grandpa that he thought
perhaps &#8220;the poor little kid was deaf!&#8221;
Jimmie was only fooling, of course, for the
Hatch baby was not deaf at all.</p>
<p>It was Sunny Boy&#8217;s turn to be chased, and
as he heard David&#8217;s robber tribe beginning
to climb up on the roof of his cave he dashed
out and ran for the other cave at the end of
the haymow. Up the side he went, and
down. Dorabelle was captured in that raid
and had to go over to David&#8217;s side.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I&#8217;ve got four in my tribe,&#8221; crowed
the robber chief. &#8220;Get your men together,
Jud, and we&#8217;ll do it again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Sunny Boy?&#8221; demanded Juddy,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
counting his tribe. &#8220;He was here&mdash;I saw
him climb up the top of the cave. Sunny
Boy! Sun-ny!&#8221;</p>
<p>No Sunny Boy answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jimmie, is Sunny Boy down there with
you?&#8221; Juddy peered over the edge of the
haymow where Jimmie sat mending the harness.
Grandpa had gone to the house, declaring
that there was a little too much noise
in the barn for his rheumatism.</p>
<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t seen him,&#8221; answered Jimmie.
&#8220;Isn&#8217;t he up there with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Juddy&#8217;s lip began to quiver. He was
only eight years old.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then he&#8217;s lost,&#8221; he said. &#8220;He isn&#8217;t here
at all, Jimmie.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jimmie dropped his harness and ran up
the little ladder that led to the haymow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; he declared sharply. &#8220;A
boy can&#8217;t get lost with a roof over him.
Likely enough he&#8217;s hiding for fun. Sunny!
Sunny Boy, where are you?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span></p>
<p>But no Sunny Boy answered. And
though Jimmie and the Hatch children
turned over the hay and looked in every corner
of the haymow, they could not find
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall I go and tell Mr. Horton?&#8221; suggested
David, who was the oldest of the
Hatch boys.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not till we have something to tell,&#8221; was
Jimmie&#8217;s answer. &#8220;Where was he when
you saw him last?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right over in that corner,&#8221; said Juddy,
pointing. &#8220;I saw him going over the top of
the cave, an&#8217; then I ducked under, and when
David got Dorabelle he just wasn&#8217;t here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He must be here&mdash;somewhere,&#8221; retorted
Jimmie impatiently. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to look
once more&mdash;and if he&#8217;s just hiding, won&#8217;t I
shake him!&#8221;</p>
<p>Jimmie climbed over the top of the &#8220;robber&#8217;s
cave,&#8221; as Sunny Boy had done, and
down on the other side. The children heard
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
him scuffling about, kicking the hay with his
feet, and then suddenly he gave a shout.</p>
<p>&#8220;You stay where you are till I come back,&#8221;
he called. &#8220;You David, and Juddy, keep
the others where they are. I&#8217;ll bet I&#8217;ve
found him.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Hatch children were fairly dancing
to follow Jimmie, but they knew he meant
what he said. They sat down in the hay to
wait.</p>
<p>One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four&mdash;five minutes passed.
Then Jimmie stepped out on the barn floor
and grinned cheerfully up at the anxious
group perched on the edge of the haymow.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve found him.
He&#8217;s out in the old dairy. Now don&#8217;t all
come down at once&mdash;Jud, let the girls come
first. Easy there!&#8221;</p>
<p>The Hatch children came tumbling down,
eager to see Sunny Boy. Sarah stopped to
pick up the baby, who had slept through all
the excitement and now merely opened two
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
dark eyes, smiled, and went to sleep again.
The Hatch baby was used to being taken
about and had the steady habits of an old
traveler.</p>
<p>They found Sunny absorbed in watching
a mother duck and her ten little ducklings
who were swimming daintily about in a
trough in the dairy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, where were you?&#8221; Juddy pounced
on Sunny Boy. &#8220;You gave us an awful
scare.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been right here all the time.&#8221;
Sunny was a bit aggrieved to find such a fuss
made over him. First Jimmie and now
Juddy. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t been anywhere,&#8221; he insisted.</p>
<p>&#8220;We thought you were lost!&#8221; David
frowned at him severely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I wasn&#8217;t,&#8221; retorted Sunny Boy
briefly. &#8220;I was watching ducks. Jimmie,
do they sleep in water?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What, ducks?&#8221; said Jimmie. &#8220;Oh, no,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
they sleep under their mother just like
chickens at night, some place where it is
warm and dry. Your grandmother will be
glad you found this duck&mdash;she&#8217;s missed her
for two days. Guess she never thought of
looking in the dairy.&#8221;</p>
<p>This part of the barn had been used for
the cows, you see, years before, when
Sunny&#8217;s father was a little boy and a big
herd of fine cows were kept at Brookside.
Now Mrs. Butterball and Butterette were
the only cows, and they lived in a box stall
near Peter and Paul.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>APPLE PIES</h3>
</div>

<p>Sunny Boy continued to look at the
ducks till David could stand it no
longer.</p>
<p>&#8220;What happened to you?&#8221; he asked, jogging
Sunny&#8217;s elbow to make him look at
him. &#8220;How&#8217;d you get down here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fell down,&#8221; said Sunny calmly.
&#8220;Could I have a duck to play with,
Jimmie?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;d you fall down?&#8221; persisted
David, who usually got what he started
after.</p>
<p>Sunny Boy was exceedingly bored by
these numerous questions, and he wanted to
be allowed to watch the ducks in peace. So
he decided the easiest way to get rid of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
David and the others would be to tell them
what they wanted to know.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll show you,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Come on.&#8221;</p>
<p>He led them out of the dairy into a little
cobwebby room, and pointed up to a square
opening.</p>
<p>&#8220;I slid through that&mdash;see?&#8221; he demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did it hurt?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Course not&mdash;I fell on the hay.&#8221;</p>
<p>The floor was thickly covered with old,
dusty hay.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the room where we used to throw
down hay to feed the cows,&#8221; explained Jimmie.
&#8220;They covered it over with loose
boards when they put in the hay three or
four years ago. But I suppose you youngsters
when romping around kicked the boards
to one side and the hay with it. Sunny,
coasting down the side of the cave, just
coasted right on through the hole and landed
down here. Lucky there was hay enough on
the floor to save him a bump.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But why didn&#8217;t you come and tell us?&#8221;
asked David. &#8220;Here we&#8217;ve been looking
all over for you. Why didn&#8217;t you sing
out?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was going to,&#8221; admitted Sunny Boy
apologetically. &#8220;But when I was hunting
for the way into the barn, I found the ducks.
Let&#8217;s go and tell Grandma we saw &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was noon by this time, so the Hatch
children went home and Sunny Boy and
Jimmie walked together to the house. It
had stopped raining, and the sun felt warm
and delightful.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you may have a duck,&#8221; said
Grandma, when Sunny Boy told her of his
find. &#8220;That foolish old mother duck
marched off with her children one morning
and I couldn&#8217;t for the life of me discover
where she had gone. And Grandpa must
board over that hole if you are going to play
in the haymow. Another time you might
hurt yourself, falling like that.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Mother?&#8221; asked Sunny Boy,
eager to tell her about the morning&#8217;s fun.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe she is up in the attic,&#8221; returned
Grandma. &#8220;She&#8217;s been up there for an hour
or so. I wish, lambie, you&#8217;d run and find
her and say dinner will be on the table in
half an hour.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny climbed the crooked, steep stairs
that led to Grandma&#8217;s attic, and found
Mother bending over an old trunk dragged
out to the middle of the floor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; he began as soon as he saw her,
&#8220;we&#8217;ve been sliding on the hay, and I found
a duck mother, an&#8217; Grandma gave me a
duck for my own. What are you doing,
Mother?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Horton was sitting on the floor, her
lap filled with a bundle of old letters.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been having a delightful morning,
too,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Grandma started to go
over these old trunks with me, and then
some one called her on the telephone and she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
had to go down. See, precious, here is a
picture of Daddy when he was a little
boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny looked over her shoulder and saw
a photograph of a stiff little boy in stiff velvet
skirt and jacket, standing by a table, one
small hand resting solemnly on a book.</p>
<p>&#8220;He doesn&#8217;t look comfy,&#8221; objected Sunny.
&#8220;Is it really Daddy? And did little boys
wear petticoats then, Mother?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That isn&#8217;t a petticoat, it is a kilt,&#8221; explained
Mother. &#8220;You know what kilts
are, dear&mdash;you&#8217;ve seen the Scotch soldiers
wear them. Well, when Daddy was a little
boy they wore kilts, and trousers underneath.
And Grandma was telling me this morning
that as soon as Daddy was out of her sight
he would take off his kilt and go about in
his blouse and trousers. So probably he
considered the kilt a petticoat just as you
do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny wandered over to another trunk
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
that stood open and poked an inquiring hand
down into its depths.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this, Mother?&#8221; he asked, holding
up a queer, square little cap.</p>
<p>&#8220;Be careful, precious, that is Grandpa&#8217;s
Civil War trunk,&#8221; warned Mother, coming
over to him. &#8220;Grandmother meant to put
the things out to air to-day and then it
rained. See, dear, this is the cap he wore,
and the old blue coat, and this is his knapsack.
Some day you must ask Grandpa to
come up here with you and tell you war
stories.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s his sword?&#8221; asked Sunny, fingering
the cap with interest. &#8220;Where was
Daddy then? Was Grandpa shot?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Grandpa didn&#8217;t have a sword, because
he wasn&#8217;t an officer,&#8221; explained Mother.
&#8220;He was only a boy when he enlisted, and
it was long before there was any Daddy,
dear. And Grandpa was wounded&mdash;I&#8217;m
sure I&#8217;ve told you that before&mdash;don&#8217;t you remember?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
That&#8217;s how he met Grandma.
She was a little girl and met him in the hospital
where her father, who was a physician,
was attending Grandpa.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Olive! Sunny! Dinner&#8217;s ready!&#8221; It
was Grandma standing at the foot of the
stairs and calling them.</p>
<p>&#8220;I forgot to tell you,&#8221; said Sunny hastily.
&#8220;Dinner will be on the table in half an
hour, Grandma said.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Horton smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the half hour has gone by,&#8221; she
declared, closing the lid of Grandpa&#8217;s trunk.
&#8220;Come, dear, we must go right down and
not keep them waiting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you going to eat your duck?&#8221; asked
Grandpa, when they were seated at the dinner
table.</p>
<p>&#8220;My, no!&#8221; answered Sunny Boy, shocked.</p>
<p>He never believed that the chickens and
ducks they had for Sunday dinners were the
same pretty feathered creatures he saw walking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
about the farm. Chickens and ducks
one ate, thought Sunny Boy, were always the
kind he remembered hanging up in the markets
at home&mdash;without any feathers or heads.
He was sure they grew that way, somewhere.</p>
<p>&#8220;He doesn&#8217;t have to eat his duck,&#8221; comforted
Grandma. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to make something
he likes this afternoon. If you and
Olive are going to drive over to town, Sunny
and I will be busy in the kitchen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Saucer pies!&#8221; cried Sunny Boy. &#8220;I can
help, can&#8217;t I, Grandma?&#8221;</p>
<p>If there was one thing Sunny Boy loved
to do, it was to be allowed to watch his
grandma bake pies. He could ask a hundred
questions and always be sure of an answer,
he could taste the contents of every
one of the row of little brown spice boxes,
and, best of all, there was a special little pie
baked for him in a saucer that he could eat
the minute it was baked and cool. No wonder
Sunny Boy kissed Mother contentedly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
and watched her drive away with Grandpa
for a little shopping in town. He, Sunny
Boy, was going to help Grandma bake apple
pies.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s your chair, and here&#8217;s a pound
Sweeting for you,&#8221; Araminta greeted him as
he trotted into the kitchen.</p>
<p>Sunny Boy scrambled into his place opposite
Grandma at the white table.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now this won&#8217;t be a very good pie,&#8221; said
Grandma, as she began to mix the pie crust.</p>
<p>Dear Grandma always said that about her
pies, even the one that won the prize at the
big fair.</p>
<p>&#8220;These apples are too sweet. But your
grandfather can never wait. He has to
have an apple pie the minute the first apple
ripens.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So do I,&#8221; announced Sunny Boy.
&#8220;What&#8217;s in this little can, Grandma?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cinnamon, lambie,&#8221; answered Grandma.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t sniff it like that&mdash;you&#8217;ll sneeze.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span></p>
<p>Sunny Boy munched his apple and
watched her as she rolled out the crust.</p>
<p>&#8220;How many, Grandma?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>Araminta, peeling apples over by the window,
laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s just like his grandfather,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Mr. Horton always says, &#8216;How many pies
are you going to make, Mother?&#8217; doesn&#8217;t
he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why does Grandpa call you Mother?&#8221;
inquired Sunny Boy of Grandma. &#8220;You&#8217;re
not his mamma.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. But you see I suppose when your
daddy was a little chap around the house,
and calling me and calling me &#8216;Mother&#8217; sixty times a day,
as you do your mamma, Grandpa got in the
habit of saying &#8216;Mother,&#8217; too. And habits,
you know, Sunny Boy, are the funny little
things that stay with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I know&mdash;we had &#8217;em in Sunday
school,&#8221; agreed Sunny absently. &#8220;Is that
my pie?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s your pie, lambie,&#8221; declared
Grandma, smiling. &#8220;One, two, three large
ones, and a saucer pie for my own laddie.
How much sugar shall I put in for you,
Sunny Boy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A bushel,&#8221; replied Sunny Boy confidently.
&#8220;Let me shake the brown powder,
Grandma.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Sunny Boy sprinkled in the cinnamon,
and Grandma added dots of butter and put
on the crust. Then she cut little slits in it
&#8220;so the apples can breathe&#8221; and then that
pie was ready for the oven.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I&#8217;m going up to change my dress
while they&#8217;re baking,&#8221; said Grandma, taking
off her apron. &#8220;If you want to stay here
with Araminta, all right, Sunny. I&#8217;ll be
back in time to take the pies out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Araminta bustled about, washing the table
top and putting away the salt and sugar
and spice box and all the things Grandma
had used for her baking. Sunny Boy ate
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
his apple quietly and waited for Grandma
to come back.</p>
<p>&#8220;My land of Goshen!&#8221; Araminta
stopped to peer out of the window over the
sink. &#8220;Here&#8217;s company driving in. If it
isn&#8217;t Mrs. Lawyer Allen, and she always
stays till supper time! And your Grandma&#8217;s
pies not out of the oven!&#8221;</p>
<p>Grandma, too, had seen the gray horse
and buggy, and she hurried down in her
pretty black and white dress.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hook my collar, please, Araminta,&#8221; she
whispered. &#8220;And I am sure the pies are
done. You can take them out very carefully
and set them where they&#8217;ll cool.
You&#8217;ll be good, won&#8217;t you, lambie? There
goes the door-bell.&#8221;</p>
<p>Grandma rustled away to meet her company,
and Araminta opened the oven door
importantly. She was seldom trusted to
take the pies from the oven alone, and she
felt very grown-up indeed to have Sunny
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
Boy see her do it. She got the three pies
out nicely, and the little saucer pie, too, and
carried them into the pantry to cool. She
set them on a shelf over the flour barrel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Grandma puts them on the table,&#8221; suggested
Sunny Boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I put them on the shelf,&#8221; said Araminta
shortly. &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe in leaving
pies around where any one can get &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now Araminta was in a hurry to go home,
for it was three o&#8217;clock, and every afternoon
from three to five she was allowed to spend
as she pleased. So, though she made the
kitchen nice and neat before she left, in her
hurry she forgot to put the lid on the flour
barrel, something Grandma always did.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going,&#8221; said Araminta, putting on
her hat with a jerk. &#8220;Mind you don&#8217;t get
into any mischief, and don&#8217;t go bothering
your grandma. Mrs. Lawyer Allen is nervous,
and she doesn&#8217;t like children.&#8221;</p>
<p>Araminta, you see, had so many brothers
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
and sisters younger than herself that she
gave advice to every child she met.</p>
<p>Sunny Boy was perfectly willing to be
good, but he was equally determined to have
his saucer pie. It was his own pie, made
and intended for him, and Araminta had no
business to put it on a shelf out of his reach.
As soon as the kitchen door closed he got a
chair and dragged it into the pantry.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s mine,&#8221; he told himself, as he stood
on the chair.</p>
<p>He pushed a white bowl out of the way,
for he remembered the yellow custard he had
knocked over on his first adventure in
Grandma&#8217;s pantry. He put his hand on his
pie and had it safe when Bruce began to
bark suddenly outside the window. Sunny
Boy leaned over to see out the window, the
chair tipped, and with a crash a frightened
little boy fell into the flour barrel which the
careless Araminta had left uncovered directly
under the shelf.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span></p>
<p>The noise of the falling chair brought
Grandma and her visitor to the pantry.</p>
<p>&#8220;What in the world!&#8221; cried Mrs. Allen,
as a small white-faced figure stared at her
over the edge of the barrel. &#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s me,&#8221; said Sunny Boy forlornly.
&#8220;There&#8217;s flour all in me, Grandma!&#8221;</p>
<p>Grandma had to laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;All over you,&#8221; she corrected. &#8220;My dear
child, are you hurt? And what were you
doing to get in the barrel?&#8221;</p>
<p>Grandma lifted Sunny Boy out and carried
him to the back porch and told him
to shake himself as Bruce did after swimming
in the brook. Only, instead of water,
clouds of flour came out of Sunny Boy&#8217;s
clothes as he tried to shake like a dog.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was getting my saucer pie, Grandma,&#8221;
he explained when she came back with a
whisk-broom and began to brush him vigorously.
&#8220;If I had some cinnamon I&#8217;d be a
pie, wouldn&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>MORE MISCHIEF</h3>
</div>

<p>When Grandma finally had Sunny
Boy all dusted free from flour, she
asked him if he thought he could keep out
of mischief till supper time.</p>
<p>He was sure he could, and ran off to find
Jimmie while Grandma and Mrs. Allen
went back to finish their interrupted visit.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Sunny,&#8221; Jimmie greeted him.
Jimmie was mending a piece of the orchard
fence. &#8220;What are you eating&mdash;pie?&#8221;</p>
<p>For Grandma had seen to it that Sunny
had his saucer pie&mdash;grandmas are like that,
you know.</p>
<p>&#8220;Want a bite?&#8221; asked Sunny.</p>
<p>But Jimmie, it seemed, had been eating
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
apples all the afternoon and he did not care
for apple pie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me help,&#8221; urged Sunny. &#8220;I can
hold the fence up, Jimmie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can stay around and talk, if you
want to,&#8221; conceded Jimmie. &#8220;It&#8217;s kind of
lonesome working all alone. But, Sunny,
honestly I can&#8217;t mend this fence if you are
going to sit on it and wiggle.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny slid down hastily.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know I was wiggling,&#8221; he apologized.
&#8220;Do you learn to mend fence at
agri&mdash;agri&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Agricultural college?&#8221; supplied Jimmie.
&#8220;No, I guess that comes natural. Will you
hand me one of those long nails, please?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny handed the nail absently. He
was thinking of other things.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you a farmer like Grandpa, Jimmie?&#8221;
he asked.</p>
<p>Jimmie finished pounding in his nail before
he answered.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Seems like I tinker up this section of
fence every other week,&#8221; he confided. &#8220;Am
I a farmer like your grandpa? Well, no,
not yet, but I aim to be. You thinking of
farming, too?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny considered this gravely.</p>
<p>&#8220;I might be a farmer,&#8221; he admitted.
&#8220;Only I think I would rather be a postman.
Could I, Jimmie?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; encouraged Jimmie.
&#8220;Nothing to stop you. And if, when you
grow up, you find you would rather be something
else, why, there&#8217;s no harm done. I&#8217;ve
heard that your father wanted to drive a
hansom cab for a life job when he was your
age. And now, instead, he drives his own
automobile.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; announced Sunny thoughtfully,
&#8220;it&#8217;s a good plan to think about what you
want to be when you grow up and then you
won&#8217;t be s&#8217;prised when you find out what
you are.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span></p>
<p>Jimmie&#8217;s mouth was too full of nails for
him to answer, but he nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll swallow a nail,&#8221; worried Sunny.
&#8220;Our dressmaker did, once. Only it was a
pin. What is this for, Jimmie?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wire clippers,&#8221; explained Jimmie
briefly. &#8220;Cut wires with &#8217;em, you know.
Leave them right there, Sunny.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jimmie was wrestling with a bit of wire
that was hard to stretch into place. Sunny
picked up the wire clippers and studied
them carefully.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder how they work?&#8221; he said to
himself. &#8220;Like Mother&#8217;s scissors? If I
only had a piece of wire I could see.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now the only wires, as Sunny very well
knew, were those stretched between the
posts. He did so wonder if the wire clippers
really could cut that thick wire! Jimmie&#8217;s
back was toward him. Sunny rested
the clippers on the top wire. He wouldn&#8217;t
really press them, just pretend to.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span></p>
<p>Snip! the heavy strand of wire parted as
though it had been a string.</p>
<p>&#8220;Give me those clippers!&#8221; Jimmie bore
down upon him crossly. &#8220;I told you to
leave &#8217;em alone. Now see what you&#8217;ve
done! Look here, Sunny, can&#8217;t you keep
out of trouble long enough for me to finish
this fence?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny yielded the clippers reluctantly.
He had not known they were so sharp.
Jimmie need not have been so cross, he
thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to do something different,&#8221; Sunny
complained.</p>
<p>Jimmie wisely decided to give him something
to do.</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t you drive that mother duck and
her ducklings up to the chicken yard?&#8221; he
asked, pointing to the same ducks Sunny had
discovered in the dairy. &#8220;I know your
grandmother wants to shut them up to-night
and that mother duck is just working her way
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
down to the brook. I want to finish this
fence before I call it a day, so if you want to
be useful, here&#8217;s your chance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course Sunny Boy wanted to be useful,
and he started after Mother Duck and
her family. If you have ever tried to argue
with a duck you will know that it does no
good to tell her where she should go&mdash;ducks
are like some people, they like to have their
own way. This mother duck had made up
her mind that she was going to take her family
down to the brook, and Sunny Boy had to
race up and down the orchard and &#8220;shoo&#8221;
her from behind trees and be patient a long
time before he could get her started in the
direction of the chicken yard. Then, once
out of the orchard, she caught a glimpse of
Araminta, who had come back&mdash;for it was
five o&#8217;clock&mdash;and was scattering cracked
corn for the chickens. The duck mother
was hungry, and she started to run toward
the chicken yard. Sunny Boy could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
scarcely keep up with her, and the poor little
baby ducks were left away behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let &#8217;em be&mdash;they&#8217;ll follow her!&#8221; cried
Araminta, and she scattered a little corn in
an empty coop.</p>
<p>The duck mother waddled right inside,
and Araminta put up a bar that fastened her
in.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think she has too many duck babies,&#8221;
said Sunny Boy, watching as the ducklings
came up to the coop and began to hunt for
corn.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, she has,&#8221; agreed Araminta. &#8220;But
she can keep them all warm, I guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know what I can do,&#8221; suggested Sunny
Boy, but Araminta was hurrying to the house
after bread and milk to feed the duck babies
and she did not ask him what he could do.</p>
<p>Mrs. Allen stayed to supper, and very
soon after Mrs. Horton said that Sunny Boy
looked sleepy and must go to bed. He seldom
took a nap any more, and as he woke up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
early in the mornings, his mother said it was
certain that he must go to bed earlier to make
up for it.</p>
<p>All the time Mother was helping him undress,
Sunny Boy was very quiet, and after
she had kissed him and tucked him in bed he
did not ask her for a story as he usually did.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been playing too hard, I think,&#8221;
said Mrs. Horton. &#8220;Good night and pleasant
dreams, dearest.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny Boy waited till she had closed the
door. Then he hopped out of bed and pattered
over to another door that led into
Grandma&#8217;s room. When he came back he
had two baby ducks in his hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;There now, you can sleep in my bed,&#8221;
he told them, putting them down under the
sheet.</p>
<p>But the baby ducks did not like the soft,
clean bed. They made funny little peeping
noises, and as soon as Sunny Boy climbed
into bed, one of them fell out and ran across
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
the floor. Sunny Boy chased it under the
bureau, and then he heard Mother calling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sunny!&#8221;</p>
<p>He opened the door a crack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Mother?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hear you running around up there.
You don&#8217;t want Mother to have to come up
and punish you, do you? Go back to bed
and go to sleep like a good boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&#8217;m,&#8221; said Sunny.</p>
<p>He might have explained that he was
good, but the ducks were certainly as bad as
they could be. It was still light enough in
the room for him to see the furniture, but try
as he might he could not get that foolish, obstinate
frightened little duck to come out
from behind the bureau. Finally he gave it
up and went to bed to take care of the other
one, and that fell or jumped out on the other
side of the bed and poor Sunny had to get
up again and try to find it. The foolish
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
thing let him chase it under the bed, and he
was half way under and half way out when
Grandpa opened the bedroom door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here, Sunny, what are you up to
now?&#8221; began Grandpa. &#8220;Your mother is
tired and she sent me up to settle you. My
soul, boy! what are you doing under the
bed?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny Boy wriggled out and turned a
flushed face to Grandpa.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; he said, beginning to climb
into bed.</p>
<p>Grandpa was helping him smooth the tangled
covers when one of the ducks began to
peep.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; said he sharply. &#8220;Sunny,
what have you got in here? What&#8217;s that
noise?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a duck,&#8221; confessed Sunny Boy reluctantly.</p>
<p>Grandpa sat down on the bed.</p>
<p>&#8220;A duck? Up here?&#8221; he gasped.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
&#8220;Why, how on earth did a duck get in the
house?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did it,&#8221; admitted Sunny. &#8220;The duck
mother had too many children, and I was
going to take care of some of &#8217;em for her.
But they wouldn&#8217;t stay in bed. I could sail
&#8217;em in the bath-tub in the mornings.&#8221;</p>
<p>Grandpa began to laugh, and then he
could not stop. He laughed till the tears
came, and Mrs. Horton heard him and came
up to scold them both. Grandma followed,
and there they all sat on the bed, Grandpa
and Mother and Grandma, all laughing as
hard as they could.</p>
<p>Sunny Boy did not think it was funny a
bit, and when he found that Grandpa was
going to take his ducks back to their own
mother that night he began to cry.</p>
<p>&#8220;By and by they would like it here,&#8221; he
sobbed. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t my woolly dog, and I
need a duck. Can&#8217;t I have one, Grandpa?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny Boy was far from being a cry-baby,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
but he was sleepy and that made him feel
unhappy, though he thought it was the
ducks. That&#8217;s a trick of the sandman&#8217;s&mdash;making
you cry easily when you&#8217;re sleepy.
However this time Grandpa was firm, and
he managed to get the duck under the bed
and the one back of the bureau and carry
them down to their mother. And very glad
they were to get there, we may believe.
Sunny Boy went to sleep in five minutes, and
long before morning had forgotten he ever
wanted baby ducks to spend the night with
him.</p>
<p>One morning, a week or more later, he
was playing on the shady side porch when
he heard Grandpa saying something to
Mother about bonds. Ever since Sunny
Boy had lost his kite and Grandpa&#8217;s bonds
with it, he always noticed when any one used
that word. No one ever spoke to him about
the lost money, and he often forgot about
it, with so many wonderful things to do
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
every day. And then, a word or two would
make him remember again.</p>
<p>&#8220;I lie awake at night worrying over those
bonds, Father,&#8221; Mrs. Horton was saying.
&#8220;Harry may be able to make it up to you
some day, but he&#8217;s having a hard time this
summer. I&#8217;ve been out and looked and
looked&mdash;some one must have picked them
up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I suppose they have,&#8221; said
Grandpa. &#8220;I advertised, and the Bonds
were numbered. Still, as you say, some one
must have found them. Don&#8217;t let it spoil
your Summer, Olive, I&#8217;ve only myself to
blame. At my age carelessness is nothing
short of a crime.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But at your age a thousand dollars is a
great deal to lose,&#8221; protested Mrs. Horton.
&#8220;And I know you meant to take a trip South
this Winter, and Harry tells me you&#8217;ve
given that up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny Boy could hear tears in Mother&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
soft voice, and he was sure she had tears in
her lovely brown eyes. He made up his
mind what to do.</p>
<p>He trotted through the wide hall, into the
sitting-room. There sat Grandpa figuring
at his desk and close beside him was Mother
with her knitting. There were bright drops
on the dark blue wool. She had been crying,
though she smiled at Sunny as he stood
in the doorway.</p>
<p>&#8220;Grandpa, listen!&#8221; Sunny Boy cried.
&#8220;You can have all the money in my bank at
home. I&#8217;ve been saving it for, oh, ever so
long. There&#8217;s a thousand dollars, I guess.
An&#8217; you can have it all&mdash;every bit. Daddy
will send it to you if I ask him. An&#8217; then
you won&#8217;t care &#8217;bout the Lib&#8217;ty Bonds!&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny Boy was surprised at the way his
offer was received. He had thought
Grandpa would be pleased and his mother,
too. And here sat Grandpa blowing his
nose, and as for his mother&mdash;Sunny Boy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
looked at her and her eyes were quite brimming
over.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you like me to?&#8221; he cried. &#8220;I was
going to buy another drum, but Grandpa can
have the money. It&#8217;s a pink pig, Grandpa,
and you shake it an&#8217; the pennies drop out.
Harriet gave it to me.&#8221; Sunny Boy&#8217;s lip began
to quiver.</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear little son!&#8221; Mother held out
her arms and Sunny Boy ran to her. &#8220;My
generous little man!&#8221; she whispered.
&#8220;Your pennies wouldn&#8217;t be enough, precious.
But I&#8217;m proud to have you offer
them to Grandpa to try to make up his loss.
That&#8217;s like your father.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny Boy sat up and stopped crying.
To be like his father was the highest praise
his mother could give him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you very much, Sunny,&#8221; said
Grandpa gravely. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t take your
bank. For one reason, we&#8217;re not sure yet
the bonds are really lost. But I tell you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
what I will do&mdash;if I ever get out of cash,
entirely out, mind you, and have to borrow
from my friends, I&#8217;ll come to you. There
are very few I&#8217;d bring myself to borrow
from, but perhaps it&#8217;s different with a grandson.
You save your pennies, and maybe
some day I&#8217;ll ask you to lend me some.
Shall we shake hands on it?&#8221;</p>
<p>And Sunny Boy and Grandpa shook hands
solemnly, like two business men.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>ANOTHER HUNT</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; declared Grandpa, putting
on his wide-brimmed hat and
reaching for his cane, &#8220;it&#8217;s high time I was
out looking after Mr. Hatch. Where are
you going, Sunny Boy?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny Boy was darting off as though a
new idea had seized him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Out,&#8221; he answered vaguely. His mind
was intent on his plan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Grandma and I have the picnic to
plan,&#8221; cried Mrs. Horton gayly. &#8220;If we are
going to have that long-promised picnic before
we go home, I for one think it is high
time we set a day.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny Boy, lingering in the doorway,
heard Grandpa grumble a little as he always
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
did if anything was said about their going
home.</p>
<p>&#8220;No reason why you shouldn&#8217;t stay here
all Summer,&#8221; he scolded. &#8220;Or if you want
to be nearer Harry, Olive, leave the boy
with us. You know we&#8217;d take good care
of him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you would; but I couldn&#8217;t leave
my baby,&#8221; Mrs. Horton said quickly.
&#8220;Bessie, my sister, you know, has a plan&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>But Araminta called Sunny just then and
he ran off without hearing about Aunt Bessie&#8217;s
plan.</p>
<p>Sunny Boy had a plan of his own, and he
was determined to carry it through. This
was nothing less than to go and hunt for
Grandpa&#8217;s lost Liberty Bonds.</p>
<p>&#8220;For I know that kite fell down right by
the old walnut tree,&#8221; said Sunny Boy to himself
for the twentieth time. &#8220;I saw it go
down&mdash;swish! I&#8217;ll bet Grandpa didn&#8217;t
look under the right tree.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span></p>
<p>Without much trouble he coaxed a big
piece of gingerbread from Araminta&mdash;who
was very curious to learn where he was going&mdash;which
he crowded into his pocket.
Expecting to be gone a long time, he took
an apple from the basket on the dining-room
table and two bananas. Bruce, lying on the
back door mat, decided to go with him, but
Bruce was beginning to get the least little
bit fat and old, and when he had followed
Sunny as far as the brook pasture and saw
that he had no intention of stopping to rest
under the trees, that wise collie dog turned
and went back to the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, there! Where are you going this
hot day?&#8221; Jimmie, setting out tomato
plants in a side field, shouted to him.</p>
<p>Sunny Boy waved his hand and plodded
on. He was a silent child when he had his
mind fixed on a certain thing, and he was
intent on finding those bonds this morning.</p>
<p>The sun was hot, and when he reached the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
pretty brook the water looked so clear and
cool that Sunny was tempted to go wading.
Only he had promised his mother not to go
in the water unless some one was with him,
and then, too, wading would delay the hunt
for the bonds. He walked along the bank
until he came to the uneven line of stones
piled together to make a crossing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I spect it wabbles,&#8221; said Sunny Boy
aloud, putting one foot on a stone, which
certainly did &#8220;teeter.&#8221;</p>
<p>He started to cross slowly, and in the
middle of the stream his right foot slipped&mdash;splash!&mdash;into
the icy cold water.</p>
<p>&#8220;My land sakes!&#8221; gasped poor Sunny
Boy, who was certainly acquiring a number
of new words, much to his mother&#8217;s worry.
&#8220;I guess that water&#8217;s as cold as&mdash;as our icebox
at home.&#8221;</p>
<p>With one wet foot and one dry foot he
finished his journey and landed safely on
the other side of the brook. He was hungry
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
by then, and so sat down to eat the gingerbread
under a large tree whose roots had
grown far out over the water.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tick-tack! Tick-tack! Tick&mdash;t-a-c-k!&#8221;
scolded some one directly over his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be cross, Mr. Squirrel!&#8221; said
Sunny Boy politely. &#8220;Grandpa says when
you make a noise like that you&#8217;re either
frightened or want folks to go away and not
bother you. I&#8217;m going in a minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>Throwing the crumbs of the gingerbread
into the brook for the little fish to enjoy,
Sunny Boy marched straight for the woods.
He had never been there alone, and somehow
they seemed darker and deeper than he
remembered them when Grandpa or Daddy
had been with him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll begin to look now,&#8221; said Sunny, talking
to himself for company. And how small
his voice sounded, and thin, under those tall,
silent trees!</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe I&#8217;ll see a Brownie,&#8221; Sunny continued.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
&#8220;I think Bruce might have come all
the way. What was that?&#8221;</p>
<p>A twig snapped under his foot with a
sharp noise. Noises are always creepy
when one is alone in a strange place. Sunny
sat down to rest a minute, on a half-buried
tree-stump.</p>
<p>A black beetle came out, ran along a weed-stalk,
climbed up to the top and sat there,
regarding Sunny steadily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you like living here?&#8221; asked Sunny
politely. &#8220;I wish you could talk, Mr. Beetle.
Maybe you&#8217;ve seen the Lib&#8217;ty Bonds
somewhere an&#8217; you&#8217;d tell me just where to
look.&#8221;</p>
<p>The beetle winked his beady eyes rapidly,
but of course he didn&#8217;t say a word.</p>
<p>Presently a striped chipmunk appeared on
a stump opposite the one where Sunny sat,
and he, too, stared at Sunny intently.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going! I&#8217;m going right away!&#8221;
Sunny assured the chipmunk hastily.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
&#8220;Daddy says you wood folks like to be alone.
I wouldn&#8217;t hurt you, but I s&#8217;pose you don&#8217;t
know that.&#8221;</p>
<p>He trotted along, eating the bananas as
he went. There were so many things to
look at and think about that sometimes he
almost forgot the Liberty Bonds. Almost,
but not quite.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Cause I just have to find &#8217;em,&#8221; he told a
blue jay that sat up in a tree and listened
sympathetically. &#8220;I&#8217;m mose sure Grandpa
didn&#8217;t look in the right place. An&#8217; won&#8217;t he
like it when I come home with them in my
pocket!&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny was so pleased with this idea that
he gave a little shout and threw his cap up
into the air, which so alarmed the blue jay
that it quickly flew away.</p>
<p>Sunny Boy was marching steadily, hands
in his pockets, when he saw something near
a stone that made him stop to look. It was
a turtle.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you run?&#8221; Sunny demanded,
picking up the turtle carefully, as he had
seen Jimmie do. &#8220;Maybe you&#8217;re the one
Grandpa carved his initials and the date on
when he came here to live. Are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>The turtle kept his head obstinately in.
Very likely he objected to being picked up
and looked at so closely. Sunny brushed
him off neatly with his clean handkerchief,
and, sure enough, on the shell he found a
date carved.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t read it,&#8221; mourned Sunny aloud.
&#8220;But I guess you&#8217;re not Grandpa&#8217;s turtle,
&#8217;cause you haven&#8217;t any initials on you. I
wish you&#8217;d put your head out, just once.&#8221;</p>
<p>But, though he put the turtle gently on
the ground again and kept very still for at
least five minutes, the queer, narrow little
head stayed safely in its shell house. The
turtle did not run away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess he thinks I&#8217;ll catch him if he
runs,&#8221; thought Sunny. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to keep
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
him if he was little. Jimmie says little turtles
are nice to keep in the garden. Maybe
I can find one on the way back, and build
him a little house under Grandma&#8217;s rose
bushes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny went on, and soon he was sure that
he was coming to the place where he had seen
his kite fall. To be sure, the inside of the
woods looked very different from the outside,
and Sunny began to understand why he
and Grandfather had not found the bonds as
easily as they had hoped to. Still, he felt
he was &#8220;getting warm&#8221; as they say in the
games of seeking, and he began to look about
him closely.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was right here&mdash;&#8221; His apple fell out
of his blouse and he stooped to pick it up.
He sprang up with a shriek and ran screaming
toward an opening in the woods.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a snake&mdash;a great, big, nasty, bitey
snake!&#8221; he sobbed. &#8220;I put my hand right
on it&mdash;all slippy and cold!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span></p>
<p>He looked back&mdash;was it a snake after all?
What was that curved black thing that lay
there so quietly at the foot of a tree?</p>
<p>Then Sunny Boy did a very brave thing
indeed. He was all alone, remember, and
there was no one to laugh at him had he gone
on home believing that he had touched a
snake. But he liked to be very sure in his
own mind, and he went back, cautiously and
ready to run if a twig snapped, but back,
nevertheless, to the place where he thought
he had seen the snake. Any one, you know,
may be frightened, but to face the fear and
see if it is an afraid thought, or something
really scary&mdash;that takes a truly brave person.
And always afterward Sunny Boy was
to be glad that he had had the courage to go
back and see.</p>
<p>For his snake was only an old twisted tree
root, after all!</p>
<p>&#8220;But I guess it&#8217;s dinner time, an&#8217; I can
come again an&#8217; look for the bonds,&#8221; he told a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
chipmunk. &#8220;Maybe Jimmie will come to-morrow
and help hunt.&#8221;</p>
<p>This time Sunny Boy crossed the stone
crossing without getting either foot wet and
he was half way up to the house when he saw
Peter and Paul standing hitched to the
fence. They had been hauling the tomato
plants for Jimmie and Grandpa, who was always
kind to the farm animals, had ordered
them to be unharnessed and tied in the shade
while the plants were being set out.</p>
<p>&#8220;No horse likes to be anchored to a wagon
when &#8217;tisn&#8217;t necessary,&#8221; said kind Grandpa.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jimmie&#8217;s always saying he will let me
ride Peter,&#8221; grumbled Sunny Boy, looking
very little as he stood by the fence, fumbling
with the strap that tied Peter fast. &#8220;Pretty
soon we&#8217;ll be going home, Mother says, and
I won&#8217;t ever learn to ride.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny&#8217;s busy, mischievous fingers had
untied the strap as he talked, and now Peter
could have walked away to the barn and his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
dinner, had he only known it. He didn&#8217;t
though, and so he was very much surprised
to feel little feet digging into him as Sunny
Boy scrambled desperately to get on his
back. Peter and Paul were fat and slow or
they never would have stood the antics of
Sunny as that small person, clinging to
Peter&#8217;s mane, and using Paul as a kind of
step-ladder, pushed and pulled and climbed
till he found himself where he wished to be&mdash;on
Peter&#8217;s broad back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee, you&#8217;re a tall horse!&#8221; he observed,
gathering the halter strap in one hand as he
had seen Jimmie take the reins. &#8220;Oh,
there&#8217;s what you ought to have on&mdash;I didn&#8217;t
see it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bridles and reins lay on the ground
where Jimmie had dropped them when he
had unharnessed the horses from the wagon.
But Sunny Boy was not minded to get down
after such a trifle&mdash;he had had too much
trouble to secure his present seat.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Gid-ap!&#8221; he said loudly, and jerked the
halter strap.</p>
<p>Over in the field, Jimmie straightened an
aching young back and gazed in amazement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say&mdash;hey, Sunny&mdash;Sunny Horton! Get
off that horse&mdash;do you hear me?&#8221; he
shouted.</p>
<p>Sunny Boy heard. He turned and
grinned impishly. He delighted to plague
Jimmie, and he was having fun guiding
Peter.</p>
<p>Then Jimmie rather lost his head. Had
he kept still, Peter would probably have
ambled gently about the meadow, perhaps
turned into the road that led to the house
and barn, and Sunny&#8217;s adventure might have
been a very mild one. But Jimmie was
frightened, and in his fear he did the one
thing that could have brought about what
he feared. He leaped the fence and came
running toward the horse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gid-ap, Peter! Go &#8217;long! Hurry!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
Sunny slapped the strap smartly across old
Peter&#8217;s neck.</p>
<p>That easy-going horse was not used to
such treatment, and he broke into a trot.
Jimmie began to shout and wave his arms.
Then Peter broke into a gallop, taking great,
long easy strides that seemed to cover miles
of ground to Sunny&#8217;s excited eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;You kind of bump!&#8221; he gasped, as the
horse galloped on. &#8220;I wonder&mdash;will&mdash;I&mdash;fall
off!&#8221;</p>
<p>Peter snorted. He had forgotten how it
felt to be running free, and perhaps he was
pretending he was a young colt again. He
paid no more attention to the small boy on
his back than if Sunny Boy had been a fly.</p>
<p>Around and around the field they tore.
Jimmie&#8217;s shouts had brought Grandpa,
and together the two watched in terrible
anxiety.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d get on Paul and chase &#8217;em, but Peter
can outrun him any day!&#8221; Jimmie almost
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
sobbed. &#8220;Say! I know what will do it.
You wait, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>He ran up to the barn and came back with
a peck measure of corn. Paul saw the long
yellow ears and whinnied with pleasure.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t get any,&#8221; Jimmie informed
him. &#8220;Lucky they hadn&#8217;t had their dinner,&#8221;
he said to Grandpa. He stood out from the
fence and rattled the measure invitingly,
and whistled.</p>
<p>Now Peter was not a colt, however much
he might enjoy pretending, and he was
getting tired of his gallop. Also he was
hungry, and he had heard Paul whinny. So
when Jimmie whistled, the old, familiar
whistle he always gave when he came in the
barn at feeding time, Peter turned and
stared. Yes, there he stood, down at the
other end of the field, and yes, he had corn
with him.</p>
<p>Peter slowed down to a gentle run, then
to a half trot, and finally came walking at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
his usual gentle gait straight up to Jimmie
and Grandpa.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sunny, Sunny, what will you do next?&#8221;
groaned Grandpa, lifting him down. &#8220;I
hope your mother didn&#8217;t see this&mdash;she would
be frightened to death.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It didn&#8217;t hurt me,&#8221; urged Sunny Boy, beginning
to wonder if he had done wrong.
&#8220;I is bumped a little, but I wasn&#8217;t afraid,
Grandpa. Was Jimmie?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You young imp!&#8221; Jimmie swooped down
upon him and hugged him so hard Sunny
squirmed uneasily. &#8220;You bet I was scared!
I thought every minute you&#8217;d tumble off.
And now do you want to ride up to the barn
with me, or have you had enough?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll ride with you,&#8221; said Sunny firmly.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>SUNNY&#8217;S GOOD LUCK</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; Grandma, a pretty picture
in her white dress that matched her
white hair, closed the side door. &#8220;Now
we&#8217;re really started.&#8221;</p>
<p>She and Grandpa and Mother and Sunny
Boy were going for their long-talked-of picnic
in the woods. Araminta had the day for
a holiday and had gone merrily off to town
to buy herself a new frock. Sunny had
wanted Jimmie to come to the picnic, but
Jimmie, too, was away. He had gone down
to the city to sell hay for Grandpa. So it
happened that just the four were to spend
the day in the woods.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;ll do without you, Sunny,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
said Grandpa, as they walked ahead, &#8220;I&#8217;m
sure I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;ll send you some of the sand,&#8221;
urged Sunny cheerfully. &#8220;And a seashell,
Grandpa.&#8221;</p>
<p>For this was Aunt Bessie&#8217;s plan. She had
written Mrs. Horton that she and a friend,
a teacher, had taken a cottage at the seashore
for the month of August, and they
wanted Sunny Boy and his mother to come
and spend that month with them. The cottage
was near enough to the city for Mr.
Horton to go down every night and stay
with them.</p>
<p>&#8220;And two weeks from to-day,&#8221; Mrs.
Horton had told Sunny Boy as he brushed
his hair that morning, &#8220;you will be going
down to the beach with a tin pail and shovel,
I expect, to play in the sand.&#8221;</p>
<p>Grandpa, carrying two boxes of lunch and
a little camp chair that folded up&mdash;because
Grandma had aches in her joints if she tried
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
to sit on the ground&mdash;smiled down at his
grandson.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well, we shall just have to have as
much fun as we can while you&#8217;re here,&#8221; he
said firmly. &#8220;Let&#8217;s have a perfectly fine
picnic with all the sandwiches we can eat
to-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; agreed Sunny enthusiastically.
&#8220;Let&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sunny, what have you found there?&#8221;
asked Grandpa after a while.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a bird,&#8221; said Sunny pitifully. &#8220;A
poor, little dead bird, Grandpa. See?&#8221;</p>
<p>He brought back the little feathered body
he had found at the foot of a tall oak tree,
and showed them.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a baby robin,&#8221; said Grandma, touching
the little thing gently. &#8220;It must have
fallen out of the nest. Don&#8217;t grieve, lambie,
nothing can hurt the little bird
now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to bury it,&#8221; insisted Sunny, tears
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
running down his face. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to
leave it on the ground, Grandma.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, you shall bury it,&#8221; said Grandpa
soothingly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll help you. Mother,
you and Olive walk along slowly and we&#8217;ll
catch up to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Grandma and Sunny&#8217;s mother walked
ahead, and Grandpa began to help Sunny
bury the baby robin.</p>
<p>First, they found a wide, smooth green
leaf that grew in the woods and wrapped this
about the dead bird and fastened it with the
sharp little thorns that grew on another
plant and which were every bit as good as
pins.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you gather the prettiest fern leaves
you can find,&#8221; directed Grandpa. &#8220;And
I&#8217;ll dig him a little grave.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Sunny Boy came back with his
hands full of soft fern leaves, Grandpa had
a little square hollowed out in the earth,
under a Jack in the Pulpit plant.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll line it with ferns, so,&#8221; he said, arranging
the leaves Sunny Boy brought him,
&#8220;and then we&#8217;ll put the bird in so, and cover
him up carefully. There! Now we&#8217;ll
leave him in his nice, green bed, dear, and
not be sorry for him any more.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see Bruce just ahead. Grandma and
Mother must be near.&#8221;</p>
<p>They came up to them in a minute, and
Sunny Boy suddenly discovered that he was
hungry.</p>
<p>&#8220;But it isn&#8217;t time for lunch yet, precious.
Take this apple and try to wait a little
longer, do,&#8221; said his mother.</p>
<p>&#8220;Feels like a thunderstorm,&#8221; declared
Grandma, sitting down on her camp-stool
to get her breath after the walk. &#8220;Well,
Bruce will tell us in time, won&#8217;t you, old
fellow?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How?&#8221; asked Sunny curiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s afraid of thunder,&#8221; explained
Grandma. &#8220;Years ago when he was a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
young dog he was out hunting rabbits or
squirrels one summer night and a big thunderstorm
came up. We always think he
must have seen a tree struck, or been stunned
by a flash, for he came home dripping and
shivering. And ever since&mdash;though that
was a long time ago&mdash;he begins to shake and
wants to hide whenever he hears thunder.&#8221;</p>
<p>The woods did not seem dark and still,
now that Sunny had company with him, and
he took Grandpa over to the place where he
and Daddy had gone fishing. They decided
not to try to catch any fish that day,
but Sunny took off his shoes and stockings
and went wading.</p>
<p>When he came out, and had his shoes and
stockings on again, Mrs. Horton spread a
white cloth on a flat rock and she and
Grandma began to get the lunch ready.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sunny, which would you rather have,&#8221;
Grandpa asked him, &#8220;white cake or black
cake?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span></p>
<p>&#8220;White, I guess,&#8221; said Sunny. &#8220;Or no&mdash;chocolate,
I think.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well, if that isn&#8217;t lucky!&#8221; cried
Grandpa, pretending to be much relieved.
&#8220;Grandma has put in both kinds!&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed there were all kinds of goodies
in those boxes&mdash;chicken and ham sandwiches,
eggs, potato salad, white cake and
black, a vacuum bottle of cold milk for
Sunny and one of hot coffee for the others.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a spider!&#8221; shouted Sunny Boy
as they sat down to eat. &#8220;Look, Grandpa,
he going right into the cake.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, spiders and ants and little creatures
like that like to come to a picnic,&#8221; answered
Grandpa, scooping up the spider on a bit of
cardboard and putting him down carefully
on a bush near by. &#8220;Mr. Spider&#8217;ll go home
to-night and tell the folks all about the little
boy he saw in the woods to-day with his
mother and his grandmother and his grandfather
having a picnic. And little Sallie
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
Spider will say, &#8216;What were they eating,
Daddy? Did you bring me any?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll sprinkle crumbs for him to get afterward,&#8221;
planned Sunny. &#8220;The fishes had
them last time, and now it is Mr. Spider&#8217;s
turn.&#8221;</p>
<p>Presently, when no one could eat another
bite, Mother and Grandmother folded up
the cloth and put the sandwiches left over in
one box. All the odds and ends were put
down on a paper plate for Bruce to eat, and
then Grandpa dug a hole in the ground and
he and Sunny Boy buried the papers out of
sight.</p>
<p>&#8220;For I won&#8217;t let any one build a fire in
my woods in July when we&#8217;re needing rain
so badly and every stick is like tinder,&#8221; said
Grandpa sturdily. &#8220;And we won&#8217;t leave a
messy picnic ground, even if it is our own,
shall we?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Horton had her knitting, and she and
Grandma sat and worked and talked quietly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
while Grandpa and Sunny Boy went off together
to try to find a sassafras bush. Just
as they had found one and Grandpa had
taken out his knife to cut a twig for Sunny
to taste, Bruce ran into him and nearly
knocked him down.</p>
<p>&#8220;Grandpa! Grandpa! Something&#8217;s the
matter with Bruce! Is he sick?&#8221; Sunny
Boy was a little frightened at the strange
way the dog acted. &#8220;Look at him! He&#8217;s
trying to walk on me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He hears thunder,&#8221; said Grandpa
quietly. &#8220;He&#8217;s trying to get you to hide
him. Funny, I haven&#8217;t heard a rumble.
But you can trust Bruce. He never fails
to tell us. We must hurry and get Mother
and Grandma back to the house before it
rains.&#8221;</p>
<p>They walked back as fast as they could to
where they had left the others, and found
Mrs. Horton folding up her knitting.</p>
<p>&#8220;We thought we heard thunder,&#8221; she said,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
as they came up to her. &#8220;I think it is clouding
up, too. Why how funny Bruce acts!
Is he sick?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s trying to tell us a storm is coming,&#8221;
replied Grandpa. &#8220;There, there, Bruce,
don&#8217;t be so silly. We&#8217;re going home, and
you can hide under the barn floor and never
even see the lightning.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sun, which had been shining down
through the trees, had gone under a cloud,
and the branches about them began to rustle
as the wind swayed them.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid we&#8217;ll have a heavy storm,&#8221;
said Grandma anxiously. &#8220;We have had
such a long dry spell and it&#8217;s been so hot.
I&#8217;d hate to be caught among these trees in
a heavy wind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, Mother,&#8221; replied Grandpa.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll be home before the first drops come.
Shall I carry you, Sunny?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny, who was running to keep up with
them, shook his head. He did not want to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
be carried like a baby. Soon it grew darker
and darker and the wind began to blow in
earnest. He pressed closer to Grandpa.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid,&#8221; said Grandpa kindly.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll be out of the woods in another
minute and then we&#8217;ll scoot across the brook
and be home.&#8221;</p>
<p>He put out a hand to help Grandmother,
when with a tremendous blast a gust of
wind made them all stop to catch their
breath. They saw it bend a tree at the edge
of the clearing and heard the tree snap
loudly as it broke and fell across the path.
Bruce howled&mdash;he was nervous, poor
animal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mercy!&#8221; gasped Grandma. &#8220;I said
we&#8217;d have a bad storm. There! I felt a
raindrop. My father always said the worst
was over when the rain began.&#8221;</p>
<p>They hurried on, anxious not to get wet,
and Sunny Boy was the first to reach the
fallen tree.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We have to go over it,&#8221; he shouted back,
and began to scramble up, holding on to the
branches.</p>
<p>&#8220;Grandpa,&#8221; they heard him scream a
moment later. &#8220;Hurry! Come quick!
Here&#8217;s my kite! The Lib&#8217;ty Bonds kite!&#8221;</p>
<p>Sure enough, there it was, just as it had
caught in the tree&mdash;the missing kite. And
still pasted to the strips of wood were
Grandpa&#8217;s two five-hundred-dollar Liberty
Bonds!</p>
<p>&#8220;No wonder we couldn&#8217;t find &#8217;em!&#8221; cried
Sunny Boy, dancing with excitement. &#8220;I
knew I saw it fall in a tree! Won&#8217;t Daddy
be glad!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re all glad,&#8221; declared Mother, kissing
him warmly. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it just wonderful
to think that the same little boy who lost the
bonds should also find them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been a lucky picnic, surely,&#8221; said
Grandpa. &#8220;After a hard rain those bonds
wouldn&#8217;t have been worth much to any one.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, they won&#8217;t be worth much now
if we all stand here and get soaked,&#8221; announced
Grandma practically.</p>
<p>At that they all took hold of hands and
ran across the meadow, over the bridge of
stones, and up to the porch. And the
moment they were safely under shelter, how
the rain did pour down! Just as if, Sunny
said, it had been waiting for them to get
home before it showed what it really could
do.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; asked Sunny Boy that night, as
he sat on the foot-board of the bed in his blue
pajamas and watched her brush her hair.
They were all tired after the excitement of
the picnic and the finding of the bonds, and
every one was going to bed at Sunny&#8217;s bed
time, even Grandpa. &#8220;Mother, will I take
my sand-box to the seashore?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, precious,&#8221; she assured him.
&#8220;Why, you&#8217;ll have a whole beach of sand to
play in. And the bathing suit I bought for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
you to wear here and which you haven&#8217;t had
on because the brook water is so cold! Perhaps
Daddy will teach you to swim.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; agreed Sunny Boy absently. And
he tumbled back on the pillows, thinking
about the seashore and the ocean which he
had never seen.</p>
<p>It was not very long after the picnic that
Mother and Sunny Boy left Brookside and
went to visit Aunt Bessie in her white
cottage that faced the ocean. And if you
want to hear about the good times Sunny
Boy had there and what he thought the
waves were saying to him when he got up
in the night to listen, you&#8217;ll have to read

club, which brings them all sorts of outdoor
adventures. In the first story, &#8220;At
Log Cabin Bend,&#8221; they solve a series of
mysteries but not until after some lively
thrills which will cause other boys to sit
on the edge of their chairs. The next
story telling of their search for a lost
army aviator in &#8220;Muskrat Swamp&#8221; is just as lively. The
boys are all likable and manly&mdash;just the sort of fellows
that every other wide-awake boy would be glad to go
hiking with.</p>

<p>The neighbors say &#8220;the
two little Fellows&#8221; when
they speak of Martin
and Jean. That is because this
small brother and sister are
always together. You just have
to think of them as a pair.</p>
<p>The Fellows family live in
Garnet, a busy city, but the
two little Fellows have a yard
all their own in which to play,
and a wonderful dog, who is very wise indeed, for
a playmate. Pleasantly exciting things happen to
Martin and Jean: sometimes little troubles ruffle
them, but in the main, this growing up day by day
is very interesting and busy work. The two little
Fellows think so and as you read about them in
these books, you&#8217;ll find you have made two new
friends.</p>
